			Apache UIMA (Unstructured Information Management Architecture) v2.1.0
		   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Supported Platforms
--------------------

Apache UIMA requires Java level 1.4; it has been tested with Sun Java SDK v1.4.2 but also with Sun Java SDK v5.0 and v6.0.
The supported platforms are: Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX and Mac OS X.  Other platforms and Java (1.4+) implementations
should work, but have not been significantly tested.

Many of the scripts in the /bin directory invoke Java. They use the value of the environment variable, JAVA_HOME, 
to locate the Java to use.


Environment Variables
----------------------

After you have unpacked the Apache UIMA distribution from the package of your choice (e.g. .zip or .gz), 
you have to do the steps below that UIMA functioning properly.

    * Set JAVA_HOME to the directory of your JRE installation you would like to use for UIMA.
    * Set UIMA_HOME to the apache-uima directory of your unpacked Apache UIMA distribution
    * Append UIMA_HOME/bin to your PATH
    
    * It is recommended to run the script UIMA_HOME/bin/adjustExamplePaths.bat (or .sh), which updates some 
      hard coded paths in the examples to your actual UIMA_HOME directory. This script runs a Java program; 
      you will need to set the environment variable JAVA_HOME to a suitable Java on your machine before running this script.


Verifying Your Installation
----------------------------

To test the installation, run the documentAnalyzer.bat (or .sh) file located in the bin subdirectory. 
This should pop up a "Document Analyzer" window. Set the values displayed in this GUI to as follows:

    * Input Directory: UIMA_HOME/examples/data
    * Output Directory: UIMA_HOME/examples/data/processed
    * TAE XML Descriptor: UIMA_HOME/examples/descriptors/analysis_engine/PersonTitleAnnotator.xml

Replace UIMA_HOME above with the path of your Apache UIMA installation.

Next, click the "Run" button, which should, after a brief pause, pop up an "Analyzed Results" window. 
Double-click on one of the documents to display the analysis results for that document.


Getting Started

Disclaimer
-----------

Apache UIMA is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with
other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily
a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does
indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
