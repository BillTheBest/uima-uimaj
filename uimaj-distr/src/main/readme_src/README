For instructions on building Apache UIMA please refer to:
http://incubator.apache.org/uima/svn.html#building.with.maven

You can run the tool packageAllJavaSourcesIntoJar.bat (or .sh) 
to package all of the java sources into a compressed Jar which can then
be used with IDEs such as Eclipse to enable those tools to have access to
the sources.  For the Eclipse IDE, for example, when it steps in 
debug mode into a class where it doesn't know about the sources,
it asks you to attach the sources - you can simply attach the
generated all-sources Jar, and it will work.

For Eclipse, there is a launch configuration you can run (if you
have checked out the uima projects into a common workspace)
called "UIMA packageAllJavaSourcesIntoJar".

Alternatively, iIf you have installed both the Apache UIMA 
binary distribution and the
Apache UIMA source distribution, you can run the addSourceJars.bat 
(or .sh) script to add the source code to the jar files in the 
UIMA_HOME/lib directory.  Note that this does not add the sources
for the Eclipse plugins (use the packageAllJavaSourcesIntoJar for 
that).  This may make it more convenient to access
the UIMA Source Code (and JavaDocs) from an IDE such as Eclipse.

Apache UIMA is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with
other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily
a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does
indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
