INAPPROP_TYPE_EXCEPTION = The value of the feature {0} cannot be accessed as type {1}, because it is {2}.
UNDEFINED_FEATURE = The value of the feature {0} on the structure of type {1} cannot be accessed, because {0} is not defined for {1}.
CANT_CREATE_BUILTIN_FS = The feature structure of type {0} cannot be created. Structures of this type cannot be created directly.
NOT_A_STRING = The structure of type {0} cannot be accessed as a String.
CYCLE_IN_TYPE_ORDER = The types are added in the wrong sort order. Adding {0} < {1} makes the sort order inconsistent.
JCAS_INIT_ERROR = The JCas cannot be initialized.  The following errors occurred: {0}
JCAS_TYPENOTFOUND_ERROR = Type information from the CAS cannot be accessed while initializing the JCas type {0}
JCAS_FEATURENOTFOUND_ERROR = Feature information from the CAS cannot be accessed while initializing the JCAS type {0} with feature {1}.
JCAS_FEATURE_WRONG_TYPE = The JCAS range type {2} for feature {1} of type {0} does not match the CAS range type {3} for the feature.
TYPEORDER_UNKNOWN_TYPE = The type sort order cannot be built because type {0} is unknown.
