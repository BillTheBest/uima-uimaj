<p>The details of all the public APIs for UIMA are contained
in the API JavaDocs.  These are located
in the docs/api directory; the top level to open in your browser is called <a
href="api/index.html">index.html</a>.</p>

<p>In recent releases, Eclipse supports the ability to attach
the JavaDocs to your project.  To use
this facility, open a project which is referring to the UIMA APIs in its class
path, and open the project properties.  </p>

<p>Once you do this, Eclipse can show you JavaDocs for UIMA
APIs as you work.  To see the JavaDoc for
a UIMA API, highlight the API class or method and press shift-F2, or use the
menu Navigate -&gt; OpenExternalJavaDoc.  This will open the JavaDoc for the selected item in a browser.</p>
