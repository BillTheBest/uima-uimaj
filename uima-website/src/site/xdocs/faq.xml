<strong>Does this project use a wiki?  </strong>
<blockquote>
It does - but it is not set up yet (November 2006). When it is, 
  it will be here: <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/uima">UIMA wiki</a>.
  It will 
complement the work taking place on the mailing list and provide
additional information on the project.
