xml id's must be unique.

We construct them hierarchically, with periods in between parts

ugr = users guide and reference
    = prefix of id's
    = first part of names
    = allows imbedding of these xmls within other documentation
 
ovv = overview and setup book   
tug = tutorial and user's guide book
tools = tools book
ref = reference book

tug.aas  aas= Annotations, Artifacts, and Sofas
tug.mvs  mvs= multiple views
tug.fc   fc = flow contoller
tug.cpe  cpe = collection processing engine 

ref.xml     = xml references
ref.xml.cd  = component descriptor
ref.xml.cpe = collection processing engine descriptor
