* Do testing on non-windows platforms to find out whether the
  framework actually works on Windows. It should, but all testing was

* Get better images for admonition and callouts.

* Maybe use SVG for PDF image rendering so the images scale.

* Force the examples (<computeroutput>) to be kept on one page.
