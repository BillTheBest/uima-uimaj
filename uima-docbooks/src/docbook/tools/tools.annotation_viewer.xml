<para>The <emphasis>Annotation Viewer</emphasis> is a tool for viewing
analysis results that have been saved to your disk as <emphasis>XCAS</emphasis> files.  XCAS is the XML representation of the
CAS.  In the UIMA SDK, XCAS files can be
generated by:</para>

<itemizedlist><listitem>Running the Document Analyzer (see
<a class="crossrefText" href="Document_Analyzer_Users_Manual.htm#_crossRef205">Chapter 17, <b>Document Analyzer
User&apos;s Guide</b></a>), which saves XCAS files to the specified
output directory.</listitem>


<listitem>Running  a Collection Processing Engine that includes
the <emphasis>XMI Writer </emphasis>CAS Consumer (<literal>docs/examples/descriptors/cas_consumer/XCasWriterCasConsumer.xml)</literal>.</listitem>


<listitem>Explicitly creating XCAS files
from your own application using the org.apache.uima.cas.impl.XCasSerializer
class.  The best way to learn how to do
this is to look at the example code for the XMI Writer CAS Consumer, located
in <literal>docs/examples/src/org/apache/uima/examples/cpe/XCasWriterCasConsumer.java</literal>.
</listitem></itemizedlist>



<note>The Annotation Viewer only shows CAS views where the Sofa data
type is a String. 
</listitem></itemizedlist>

<para>You can run the Annotation Viewer by executing the <literal>xcasAnnotationViewer</literal> shell script located in the bin
directory of the UIMA SDK.  This will
open the following window:</para>

<para><img alt="" width="488" height="210"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/XCAS_Annotation_Viewer_files/image002.jpg"/></para>

<para>Select an input directory (which must contain XCAS files),
and the descriptor for the TAE that produced the Analysis (which is needed to
get the type system for the analysis).  Then press the <quote>View</quote> button.</para>

<para>This will bring up a dialog where you can select a viewing
format and double-click on a document to view it.  This dialog is the same as the one that is
described in Chapter <a class="crossrefText" href="Document_Analyzer_Users_Manual.htm#_crossRef208">17.3, <b>Viewing the Analysis
Results</b></a>.</para>
