		      Velocity DocBook Framework
		      ==========================


This project started out as a framework to render documentation for
the Velocity project (http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/) and ended
somehow up to be a generic framework to render DocBook documents using
Java and driven by ant.

While DocBook format seems to be ubiquitous these days, to my surprise
there were not many generic frameworks around that could render all
kinds of formats using Java and be easily customizable. Projects
either use heavily customized and hacked style sheets or a mix of Java
and other applications. Adjusting such a rendering framework to the
needs of the Velocity project wasn't easy, so at some point, we decided
to redo this (almost) from scratch.

Why another framework for rendering docbook?
============================================

The Velocity project uses a simple HTML based format called XDOC for
its documentation for a very long time. However, XDOC is not really
popular outside the Apache world (and not even in the Apache world),
it renders somehow into HTML but no other formats (unless you consider
a set of alpha and beta-level Maven plugins) and tool support for this
format is not really there.

When an XML based format for documentation is considered, DocBook
seems to be a natural choice. So we decided to take a stab at rendering
the existing Velocity Docs that are end-user specific (Users Guide,
Developers Guide, Reference and the likes) through DocBook.

What we wanted to have, was a framework, that

* Renders multiple documents into multiple formats with an uniform look
  without having to copy a large number of stylesheets, images and other
  supporting files around

* Uses the standard DocBook XML and XSL zip files available for
  download. Many of the open source DocBook framework use heavily
  hacked versions and we want to be able to keep up with releases
  without having to patch the released files every time.

* Use current versions of the DocBook reference files, the libraries
  and supporting tools. 

* Render all formats without connecting to the Internet. Using 
  the Apache XML resolver it should be possible to use the framework
  completely standalone. See
  http://xml.apache.org/commons/components/resolver/resolver-article.html
  for an explanation.

* has some documentation so you understand what happens when a format
  gets rendered and how. That can be customized easily (if you consider
  customizing complex XSL style sheets 'easy' :-) )

* 100% pure Java. No external programs needed or called.

* ant-driven, platform independent.


What you need
=============

* A Java Runtime. All testing has been done using the Sun JSDK 1.5.0

* Apache Ant version 1.6 or better. The build script uses the macrodef
  task which was introduced in ant 1.6. Get it from http://ant.apache.org/

Everything else should be included in this package.


How it is used
==============

The documents to render are located in src/docbook. Here you find
subdirectories and each subdirectory contains one set of docbook files.

If you run ant in the base directory of this distribution, it should
build a target directory in target/ for each directory in
src/docbook. In each of the directories, you'll find three
subdirectories: pdf, html and htmlsingle.

pdf:		PDF format. 
html:		Multiple HTML files, one for each section.
htmlsingle:	One big HTML file.

Both of the HTML format directories will also contain a .zip file for
distribution.


Notes
=====

* Changing the paper size

  The docbook framework renders its pages in "Letter" format
  (8.5 x 11 inches).  This allows printing in both, Letter and A4
  format. If you want to reformat the PDF documentation in A4, you
  can use the 'paper.type' parameter:

  ant -Dpaper.type=A4 will render the documentation in A4.


Add a new DocBook document
==========================

You create a new subdirectory inside src/docbook. In there goes your
new docbook document. If you need images for your document, they go
into src/images. Inside your document, they should be referenced as
'images/<yourimage>>' because this is where they will end up during
the render process.

In the main build.xml file, you must add a call to the framework for
your new document. E.g. this is for the Velocity Users guide:

<ant antfile="build-docbook.xml" target="all">
  <property name="docbook.dir" value="userguide"/> (1)
  <property name="docbook.file" value="VelocityUsersGuide"/> (2)
</ant>

(1) This is the subdirectory in src/docbook
(2) This is the name of the main docbook file *WITHOUT* the
    ending. The framework will add .xml for the source file.

When you add a new document to the framework, you must make sure that
its referenced DocBook DTD files can be resolved by the Catalog
resolver. Currently, the resolver knows about DocBook 4.4, so your
document declaration should be

<!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.4//EN"
       "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.4/docbookx.dtd">

If you use another doctype definition, the framework will still work,
but connect to the Internet to get the definition files every time you
run the build process.


How it works (in depth)
=======================

Take a look at the MANIFEST file first to get an idea what is in this
package and what the various files are supposed to do.


ant files
---------

The build.xml file contains only the driver targets for rendering the
documentation. The actual work is done through targets defined in
build-docbook.xml. This file normally should not be changed; if you
have to, please let the developers know, so we can incorporate your
changes and or bug fixes into the main distribution.

build-docbook.xml contains three main targets: pdf, html and
htmlsingle. Each is responsible for rendering one format.

Most settings are done in the project.properties file and there should
be no need to change these properties.


DocBook reference files
-----------------------

This framework uses the DocBook XML and XSL distribution archives
without any changes to them. The reference files are located in
src/zip and are expanded into the target/ directory before the
rendering process. The file names must be reflected in the
docbook.xml.version and docbook.xsl.version properties in the
project.properties file. If you want to use e.g. a newer XSL version,
you can put it into src/zip and update project.properties to reflect
the change.


XML Resolver
------------

The framework uses the Apache XML commons resolver to avoid accessing
the Internet for Catalog files. The resolver is configured through the
CatalogManager.properties and xml-catalog.xml files in the base
directory of the distribution. If you update e.g. the Docbook XML
version, you must also update the catalog file to match the new
version.


Docbook Source files
--------------------

The sources for each DocBook document to render should be in
src/docbook. Each document has its own subdirectory and gets rendered
separately. Adding a new document is described in "Adding a new
DocBook document" above.


Stylesheets and Driver files
----------------------------

For each of the formats used by the framework, a stylesheet driver
file exists in src/styles. These files are pdf.xsl, html.xsl and
htmlsingle.xsl.

The driver files are intended to reference the actual style sheet
customization and to add some framework specific elements through
filtering. This two step process has been chosen because html and
htmlsingle are very similar and it makes no sense to maintain two sets
of stylesheet customizations that are virtually identical.

Before usage, these files are copied to target/tmp using an ant filter
set. This allows you to use the following replacements in the driver
files:

@file.prefix@     - Prefix for loading a file through the XSL
                    processor. Is 'file://' for Unix and 'file:///'
                    for Windows (defined in the build-docbook.xml ant
                    file).

@docbook.xml@     - Location of the DocBook XML files

@docbook.xsl@     - Location of the DocBook XSL style sheets

@src.dir@         - Location of ${basedir}/src

@tmp.dir@         - Location of ${basedir}/target/tmp

@<type>.target.dir@ - (pdf.target.dir for PDF, html.target.dir
                       and htmlsingle.target.dir for HTML) which points
                       to the target directory into which the document
                       is rendered.

Please note, that *only* the driver file is filtered! If you have path
adjustments to make, you must do them in the driver file!

Please look at the provided driver files in src/styles on how to use
the filter set.


StyleSheet customizations
-------------------------

These customizations are located in subdirectories in
src/styles. Currently there are only two: pdf and html (html and
htmlsingle use the same set of customizations). They are referenced
from the driver files as src/styles/<subdirectory>/custom.xsl.


PDF StyleSheet information
--------------------------

In the footer, the <releaseinfo> and <productname> elements of the
DocBook document are displayed. Each document should have these fields
defined.


Titlepages
----------

PDF and HTML use custom title pages. These are located in the
respecting src/styles subdirectories as titlepage.xml template
definitions. The build process renders these files using the DocBook
XSL template/titlepage.xsl Stylesheet into the target/tmp/ directory
as <type>-titlepage.xsl (e.g. target/tmp/pdf-titlepage.xsl). This
style sheet then must be included in the style sheet driver file (see
the driver files in src/styles, e.g. pdf.xsl).

The current titlepage reference a project logo which must be located
as 'logo.png' in the src/images directory. It gets rendered on both
the HTML and PDF title pages.


HTML CSS
--------

There is support for a CSS file in the html and htmlsingle render
process. This file is defined in the HTML customization file
(src/styles/html/custom.xsl) and must be located in the src/css/html
directory. It is copied into a css subdirectory in the target and must
be referenced as css/<filename>. See the HTML customization file and
the build-docbook.xml on how this is done.

Currently, only a single style sheet is supported for both html and
htmlsingle.


Acknowledgements
----------------

DocBook is a fairly complex format and using and customizing the XSL
style sheets available is not really straightforward. So by googling
left and right and looking at other DocBook rendering frameworks that
are in the open source, we tried to model similarities and sometimes
actually copied some of the ideas.

This DocBook framework is literally standing on the shoulders of other
projects, in particular:

* The DocBook Format by Norman Walsh; (C) 1999-2006 by Norman Walsh,
  OASIS and O'Reilly, especially all the documentation that is
  available from http://www.docbook.org/

* The DocBook FAQ maintained by Dave Pawson. We wouldn't have survived
  without that. (http://www.dpawson.co.uk/docbook/)

* DocBook XSL: The Complete Guide by Bob Stayton. This is an invaluable
  reference to the DocBook style sheets. Find it online at
  http://sagehill.net/ or buy the E-book.

* The DocBook Project located at http://docbook.sourceforge.net/. They
  maintain the XSL style sheets used to transform DocBook into
  other formats and also link to the docbook mailing list archives.

* The Apache XML commons resolver from
  http://xml.apache.org/commons/components/resolver/

Ideas on how to render elements, to arrange things and how to do more
obscure things like title pages or use CSS to render HTML, I've taken
(sometimes literally by cut'n'paste) from

* The Spring Framework documentation. This is how we got hooked on the
  idea that Velocity should have DocBook documentation, too. Their
  DocBook framework is really nice, however for my needs it proved to
  be 'not exactly what we was looking for' (see above).

  Spring is IMHO an example that good documentation makes all the
  difference between a successful and popular project and 'the
  others'. Thanks a lot, Spring guys!

* The "ant and docbook" styler suite by Dawid Weiss, available from
  http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/dweiss/xml/projects/ant-docbook-styler/index.xml
. We stole his CSS style sheet almost verbatim. Thanks a lot, Dawid! 

* The Maven sdocbook plugin by Siegfried Goeschl, Per Olesen and
  Carlos Sanchez, available at the SourceForge Maven plugin page
  at http://maven-plugins.sourceforge.net/maven-sdocbook-plugin/

* The XMLmind XML Editor from http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/
  This is a cross-platform, pure Java editor that not only runs well
  on Linux, Windows and MacOS but also offers DocBook WYSIWYG support
  and has a free version. And if you pay for it, you get the source
  code for it too.
