<section name="Annotator and Analysis Engine Developer&rsquo;s Guide"><a id="_crossRef1"> </a>



<p>This chapter describes how to develop UIMA <i>type systems</i>,
<i>Annotators</i> and <i>Analysis Engines</i> using the UIMA SDK.  It is helpful to read the UIMA Conceptual
Overview chapter for a review on these concepts.</p>

<p>An <i>Analysi</i>s<i> Engine (AE)</i> is a program that
analyzes artifacts (e.g. documents) and infers information from them.  A <i>TAE</i> is a specialization of an
Analysis Engine that analyzes a particular artifact, which is often, for
example, a text document (but could be, in general, audio streams, etc.).</p>

<p>In the UIMA SDK, Analysis Engines are constructed from
building blocks called <i>Annotators</i>.  An annotator is a component that contains analysis logic.  Annotators analyze an artifact (for example,
a text document) and create additional data (metadata) about that
artifact.  It is a goal of UIMA that annotators
need not be concerned with anything other than their analysis logic &ndash; for
example the details of their deployment or their interaction with other annotators.</p>

<p>An Analysis Engine (AE) may contain a single annotator
(this is referred to as a <i>Primitive AE)</i>, or it may be a composition of
others and therefore contain multiple annotators (this is referred to as an <i>Aggregate
AE</i>).  Primitive and aggregate AEs
implement the same interface and can be used interchangeably by applications.</p>

<p>Annotators produce their analysis results in the form of
typed <i>Feature Structures</i>, which are simply data structures that have a
type and a set of (attribute, value) pairs.  An <i>annotation</i> is a particular type of Feature Structure that is
attached to a region of the artifact being analyzed (a span of text in a
document, for example).  </p>

<p>For example, an annotator may produce an Annotation over
the span of text <code>President Bush</code>, where the type of
the Annotation is <code>Person</code> and the attribute <code>fullName</code> has the value <code>George W. Bush</code>,
and its position in the artifact is character position 12 through character
position 26.  </p>

<p>It is also possible for annotators to record information
associated with the entire document rather than a particular span (these are
considered Feature Structures but not Annotations).  </p>

<p>All feature structures, including annotations, are
represented in the UIMA <i>Common Analysis Structure</i> (<i>CAS)</i>.  The CAS is the central data structure through
which all UIMA components communicate.  Included with the UIMA SDK is an easy-to-use, native Java interface to
the CAS called the <i>JCas</i>.  The JCas
represents each feature structure as a Java object; the example feature
structure from the previous paragraph would be an instance of a Java class
Person with getFullName() and setFullName() methods.  Though the examples in this guide all use the
JCas, it is also possible to directly access the underlying CAS system; for
more information see <a class="crossrefText" href="CAS_Reference.htm#_crossRef77">Chapter 26, <b>CAS Reference</b></a>.     </p>

<p>The remainder of this chapter will refer to the analysis
of text documents and the creation of annotations that are attached to spans of
text in those documents.  Keep in mind
that the CAS can represent arbitrary types of feature structures, and feature
structures can refer to other feature structures.  For example, you can use the CAS to represent
a parse tree for a document.  Also, the
artifact that you are analyzing need not be a text document.</p>

<subsection name="Getting Started"><a id="_crossRef2"> </a>



<p>This section is a
step-by-step tutorial that will get you started developing UIMA annotators.  All of the files referred to by the examples
in this chapter are in the docs/examples directory of the UIMA SDK.  This directory is designed to be imported
into your Eclipse workspace; see section <a class="crossrefText" href="UIMA_SDK_Installation_and_Setup.htm#_crossRef379">3.2, <b><i>Setting
up Eclipse to view Example Code</i></b></a> for instructions on how to do this. Also you
may wish to refer to the UIMA SDK JavaDocs located in the <a
href="api/index.html">docs/api</a> directory.  </p>

<ul class="note"><li>In Eclipse 3.1, if you highlight a UIMA class or method defined in the
UIMA SDK JavaDocs, you can conveniently have Eclipse open the corresponding
JavaDoc for that class or method in a browser, by pressing Shift + F2.
</li></ul>

<p>The example annotator
that we are going to walk through will detect room numbers for rooms at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center (where the UIMA SDK originated).  There are two Watson buildings: Yorktown and Hawthorne, and each has its own pattern for room
numbers.  Here are some examples,
together with their corresponding regular expression patterns:</p>

<p><u>Yorktown</u>:  20-001, 31-206, 04-123(Pattern:
##-[0-2]##)</p>

<p><u>Hawthorne</u><u>:</u> GN-K35, 1S-L07, 4N-B21(Pattern: [G1-4][NS]-[A-Z]##)</p>

<p>There are several
steps to develop and test a simple UIMA annotator.</p>

<ol class="compact"><li>Define the CAS types that the annotator
will use.</li>


<li>Generate the Java classes for
these types.</li>


<li>Write the actual annotator Java
code.</li>


<li><a id="_crossRef3">Create the Analysis Engine
descriptor.</a></li>


<li>Test the annotator.
</li></ol>

<p>These steps are
discussed in the next sections.</p>



<h3><a id="_crossRef4">Defining Types</a></h3>

<p>The first step in developing an annotator is to define the
CAS Feature Structure types that it creates.  This is done in an XML file called a <i>Type System Descriptor</i>. UIMA
defines some basic built-in CAS types such as TOP, Boolean, Byte, Short, Integer,
Long, Float, Double, Arrays of primitives and FSArray, and Annotation.  TOP is the root of the type system, analogous
to Object in Java.  FSArray is an array
of Feature Structures (i.e. an array of instances of TOP). </p>

<p>UIMA includes an Eclipse plug-in that will help you edit
Type System Descriptors, so if you are using Eclipse you will not need to worry
about the details of the XML syntax.  See
<a class="crossrefText" href="UIMA_SDK_Installation_and_Setup.htm#_crossRef372">Chapter 3, <b>UIMA SDK Setup for
Eclipse</b></a> for instructions on setting up
Eclipse and installing the plugin.</p>

<p>The Type System Descriptor for our annotator is located in
the file <code>descriptors/tutorial/ex1/TutorialTypeSystem.xml.</code>  (This and all other examples are located in
the docs/examples directory of the UIMA SDK, which can be imported into an
Eclipse project for your convenience, as described in <a class="crossrefText" href="UIMA_SDK_Installation_and_Setup.htm#_crossRef379">3.2, <b><i>Setting
up Eclipse to view Example Code</i></b></a><i>.</i>) </p>

<p>In Eclipse, expand the uima_examples project in the
Package Explorer view, and browse to the file <code>descriptors/tutorial/ex1/TutorialTypeSystem.xml</code>.  Right-click on the file in the navigator and
select Open With -&gt; Component Descriptor Editor.  Once the editor opens, click on the
&quot;Type System&quot; tab at the bottom of the editor window.  You should see a view such as the following:</p>

<p><img alt="" width="575" height="339"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image002.jpg"/></p>

<p>Our annotator will need only one type &ndash; c<code>om.ibm.uima.tutorial.RoomNumber</code>.  (We use the same namespace conventions as are
used for Java classes.)  Just as in Java,
types have supertypes.  The supertype is
listed in the second column of the left table.  In this case our RoomNumber annotation extends from the built-in type <code>uima.tcas.Annotation</code>.</p>

<p>Descriptions can be included with types and features.  In this example, there is a description
associated with the <code>building</code> feature.  To see it, hover the mouse over the feature.</p>

<p>The bottom tab labeled &quot;Source&quot; will show you
the XML source file associated with this descriptor. </p>

<p>The built-in Annotation type declares two fields (called <i>Features</i>
in CAS terminology) &ndash; begin and end.  These features store the character offsets of the span of text to which
the annotation refers.  Our RoomNumber
type will inherit these features from <code>com.tcas.Annotation</code>,
its supertype; they are not visible in this view because inherited features are
not shown.  One additional feature, <code>building</code>, is declared.  It takes a String as its value.  Instead of String, we could have declared the range-type of our feature
to be any other CAS type (defined or built-in).    </p>

<p>If you are not using Eclipse, if you need to edit the type
system, do so using any XML or text editor, directly.  The following is the actual XML
representation of the Type System displayed above in the editor:</p>

<p class="xmp">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;typeSystemDescription   xmlns=&quot;http://uima.watson.ibm.com/resourceSpecifier&quot;&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;TutorialTypeSystem&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;Type System Definition for the tutorial examples - as of Exercise 1&lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;vendor&gt;IBM&lt;/vendor&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;types&gt;
    &lt;typeDescription&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;com.ibm.uima.tutorial.RoomNumber&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;description&gt;&lt;/description&gt;
      &lt;supertypeName&gt;uima.tcas.Annotation&lt;/supertypeName&gt;
      &lt;features&gt;
        &lt;featureDescription&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;building&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Building containing this room&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;rangeTypeName&gt;uima.cas.String&lt;/rangeTypeName&gt;
      &lt;/featureDescription&gt;
    &lt;/features&gt;
   &lt;/typeDescription&gt;
&lt;/types&gt;
&lt;/typeSystemDescription&gt;</p>

<h3><a id="_crossRef5">Generating Java Source Files for
CAS Types</a></h3>

<p>When you save a descriptor that you have modified, the
Component Descriptor Editor will automatically generate Java classes
corresponding to the types that are defined in that descriptor (unless this has
been disabled), using a utility called JCasGen.  These Java classes will have the same name (including package) as the
CAS types, and will have get and set methods for each of the features that you
have defined.</p>

<p>This feature is enabled/disabled using the UIMA menu
pulldown (or the Eclipse Preferences &ndash; UIMA).  If automatic running of JCasGen is not happening, please make sure the
option is checked:</p>

<p><img alt="" width="575" height="83"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image004.jpg"/></p>

<p>The Java class for the example
com.ibm.uima.tutorial.RoomNumber type can be found in <code>src/com/ibm/uima/tutori</code><code>al/RoomNumber.java</code>.   You will see how to use these generated classes in the next
section.  </p>

<p>If you are not using the Component Descriptor Editor, you
will need to generate these Java classes by using the <i>JCasGen</i> tool.  JCasGen reads a Type System Descriptor XML
file and generates the corresponding Java classes that you can then use in your
annotator code.  To launch JCasGen,
simply execute the jcasgen shell script located in the bin directory of the
UIMA SDK.  This should launch a GUI that
looks something like this:</p>

<p><img alt="" width="534" height="279"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image006.jpg"/></p>

<p>Use the &quot;Browse&quot; buttons to select your input
file (TutorialTypeSystem.xml) and output directory (the root of the source tree
into which you want the generated files placed).  Then click the &quot;Go&quot; button.  Assuming no errors in the Type System
Descriptor, new Java source files should be generated under the specified
output directory.  </p>

<p>There are some additional options to choose from when
running JCasGen; please refer to the <a class="crossrefText" href="JCasGen_Users_Guide.htm#_crossRef222">Chapter 19, <b>JCasGen User Guide</b></a>
for details.</p>



<h3><a id="_crossRef6">Developing Your Annotator Code</a></h3>

<p>Annotator implementations all implement a standard
interface, having several methods, the most important of which are:  </p>

<ul class="compact"><li><code>initialize</code>,
</li>


<li><code>process</code>,
and </li>


<li><code>destroy</code>.  
</li></ul>

<p><code>initialize</code> is called by the
framework once when it first creates the annotator.  <code>process</code> is called
once per item being processed.  <code>destroy</code> may be called by the application when it is done.
There is a default implementation of this interface for annotators using the JCas,
called JTextAnnotator_ImplBase, which has implementations of all required
methods except for the process method.  </p>

<p>Our annotator class extends the JTextAnnotator_ImplBase;
most annotators that use the JCas will extend from this class, so they only
have to implement the process method.  Even
though this class name has the word &quot;Text&quot; in it, it is not
restricted to handling just text; see <a class="crossrefText" href="SOFA_Developers_Guide.htm#_crossRef286">Chapter
8, <b><i>Annotations, Artifacts, and Sofas</i></b></a> <a class="crossrefPage" href="SOFA_Developers_Guide.htm#_crossRef286"></a>.</p>

<p>Annotators are not required to extend from the
JTextAnnotator_ImplBase class; they may instead directly implement the
JTextAnnotator interface, and provide all method implementations
themselves.  This allows you to have your
annotator inherit from some other superclass if necessary. If you would like to
do this, see the JavaDocs for JTextAnnotator for descriptions of the methods
you must implement.</p>

<p>Annotator classes need to be public and have public,
0-argument constructors, so that they can be instantiated by the framework<span class="footnote">
Although Java classes in which you do not define any constructor will, by
default, have a 0-argument constructor that doesn't do anything, a class in
which you have defined at least one constructor does not get a default
0-argument constructor.</span>.   </p>

<p>The class definition for our RoomNumberAnnotator
implements the process method, and is shown here.  You can find the source for this in the <code>uima_examples/src/com/ibm/uima/tutorial/ex1/RoomNumberAnnotator.java</code>.
 Note: In Eclipse, in the &quot;Package
Explorer&quot; view, this will appear by default in the project <code>uima_examples</code>, in the folder <code>src</code>,
in the package <code>com.ibm.uima.tutorial.ex1</code>.  In Eclipse, open the RoomNumberAnnotator.java
in the uima_examples project, under the src directory.</p>

public class RoomNumberAnnotator extends JTextAnnotator_ImplBase
{
  private Pattern mYorktownPattern = 
    Pattern.compile(&quot;\b[0-4]\d-[0-2]\d\d\b&quot;);
  private Pattern mHawthornePattern =

  public void process(JCas aJCas, ResultSpecification aResultSpec)
    throws AnnotatorProcessException
  {
    // Discussed Later
  }
}</p>

<p>The two Java class fields, mYorktownPattern and mHawthornePattern,
hold regular expressions that will be used in the process method.  Note that these two fields are part of the
Java implementation of the annotator code, and not a part of the CAS type
system. We are using the regular expression facility that is built into Java
1.4.  It is not critical that you know
the details of how this works, but if you are curious the details can be found
in the Java API docs for the java.util.regex package.  </p>

<p>The only method that we are required to implement is
process.  This method is typically called
once for each document that is being analyzed.  This method takes two arguments.  The JCas holds the document to be analyzed and all of the analysis
results.  We'll ignore the
ResultSpecification for now; its use is not required. </p>

<p class="xmp">  /**
   * @see JTextAnnotator#process(JCas,ResultSpecification)
   */
  public void process(JCas aJCas, ResultSpecification aResultSpec)
    throws AnnotatorProcessException
  {
    //get document text
    String docText = aJCas.getDocumentText();
    //search for Yorktown room numbers
    Matcher matcher = mYorktownPattern.matcher(docText);
    int pos = 0;
    while (matcher.find(pos))
    {
      //found one - creation annotation
      RoomNumber annotation = new RoomNumber(aJCas);
      annotation.setBegin(matcher.start());
      annotation.setEnd(matcher.end());
      annotation.setBuilding(&quot;Yorktown&quot;);
      annotation.addToIndexes();
      pos = matcher.end();
    }
    //search for Hawthorne room numbers
    matcher = mHawthornePattern.matcher(docText);
    pos = 0;
    while (matcher.find(pos))
    {
      //found one - creation annotation
      RoomNumber annotation = new RoomNumber(aJCas);
      annotation.setBegin(matcher.start());
      annotation.setEnd(matcher.end());
      annotation.setBuilding(&quot;Hawthorne&quot;);
      annotation.addToIndexes();
      pos = matcher.end();
    }     
  }</p>

<p>The Matcher class is part of the java.util.regex package
and is used to find the room numbers in the document text.  When we find one, recording the annotation is
as simple as creating a new Java object and calling some set methods:</p>

<p class="xmp">  RoomNumber annotation = new RoomNumber(aJCas);
  annotation.setBegin(matcher.start());
  annotation.setEnd(matcher.end());
  annotation.setBuilding(&quot;Yorktown&quot;);</p>

<p>This RoomNumber class was generated from the type system
description by the Component Descriptor Editor or the JCasGen tool, as
discussed in the previous section.</p>

<p>Finally, we call annotation.addToIndexes() to add the new
annotation to the indexes maintained in the CAS.  By default, the CAS implementation used for
analysis of text documents keeps an index of all annotations in their order
from beginning to end of the document.  Subsequent annotators or applications use the indexes to iterate over
the annotations.  It is also possible to
define your own custom indexes in the CAS (see <a class="crossrefText" href="CAS_Reference.htm#_crossRef77">Chapter 26, <b>CAS Reference</b></a> for details). </p>

<ul class="note"><li>If you don't add the instance
to the indexes, it cannot be retrieved by down-stream annotators, using the
indexes.
</li></ul>

<p>We're almost ready to test the RoomNumberAnnotator.  There is just one more step remaining.</p>

<h3><a id="_crossRef7">Creating the XML Descriptor</a></h3>

<p>The UIMA architecture requires that descriptive
information about an annotator be represented in an XML file and provided along
with the annotator class file(s) to the UIMA framework at run time.  This XML file is called an <i>Analysis Engine
Descriptor</i>.  The descriptor includes:</p>

<ul><li>Name, description, version, and
vendor</li>


<li>The annotator&rsquo;s inputs and outputs,
defined in terms of the types in a Type System Descriptor</li>


<li>Declaration of the configuration
parameters that the annotator accepts
</li></ul>

<p>The <i>Component Descriptor Editor</i> plugin, which we
previously used to edit the Type System descriptor, can also be used to edit
Analysis Engine Descriptors.</p>

<p>A descriptor for our RoomNumberAnnotator is provided with
the UIMA distribution under the name <code>descriptors/tutorial/ex1/RoomNumberAn</code><code>notator.xml.</code>  To
edit it in Eclipse, right-click on that file in the navigator and select Open
With &ndash;&gt;
Component Descriptor Editor.  </p>

<p>Eclipse tip: You can double click
on the tab at the top of the Component Descriptor Editor's window identifying
the currently selected editor, and the window will &quot;Maximize&quot;.  Double click it again to restore the original
size.  </p>

<p>If you are not using Eclipse, you will need to edit Analysis
Engine descriptors manually.  See <b><a class="crossrefText" href="Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide.htm#_crossRef36">Introduction to
Analysis Engine Descriptor XML Syntax</a></b> <a class="crossrefPage" href="Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide.htm#_crossRef36"></a> for an introduction to the Analysis Engine descriptor
XML syntax.  The remainder of this
section assumes you are using the Component Descriptor Editor plug-in to edit
the Analysis Engine descriptor.</p>

<p>The Component Descriptor Editor consists of several tabbed
pages; we will only need to use a few of them here.  For more information on using this editor,
see <a class="crossrefText" href="Component_Descriptor_Editor_Users_Guide.htm#_crossRef96">Chapter 12, <b>Component Descriptor
Editor User&rsquo;s Guide</b></a></p>

<p>The initial page of the Component Descriptor Editor is the
Overview page, which appears as follows  </p>

<p><img alt="" width="575" height="313"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image008.jpg"/></p>

<p>This presents an overview of the RoomNumberAnnotator Analysis
Engine (AE).  The left side of the page
shows that this descriptor is for a <i>Primitive</i> AE (meaning it consists of
a single annotator), and that the annotator code is developed in Java.   Also, it specifies the Java class that
implements our logic (the code which was discussed in the previous
section).   Finally, on the right side of
the page are listed some descriptive attributes of our annotator.</p>

<p>The other two pages that need to be filled out are the
Type System page and the Capabilities page.  You can switch to these pages using the tabs at the bottom of the
Component Descriptor Editor.  In the
tutorial, these are already filled out for you.</p>

<p>The RoomNumberAnnotator will be using the
TutorialTypeSystem we looked at in Section <a class="crossrefText" href="Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide.htm#_crossRef4">4.1.1, <b>Defining Types</b></a>.  To
specify this, we add this type system to the Analysis Engine's list of Imported
Type Systems, using the Type System page's right side panel, as shown here:</p>

<p><img alt="" width="576" height="257"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image010.jpg"/></p>

<p>On the Capabilities page, we define our annotator's inputs
and outputs, in terms of the types in the type system.  The Capabilities page is shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" width="511" height="398"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image012.jpg"/></p>

<p>Capabilities come in sets; here we're just using one
set.  The RoomNumberAnnotator is very
simple.  It requires no input types, as
it operates directly on the document text -- which is supplied as a part of the
CAS initialization (and which is always assumed to be present).  It produces only one output type
(RoomNumber), and it sets the value of the building feature on that type.  This is all represented on the Capabilities
page.</p>

<p>The Capabilities page has two other parts for specifying
languages and Sofas.  The languages
section allows you to specify which languages your Analysis Engine
supports.  The RoomNumberAnnotator
happens to be language-independent, so we can leave this blank.  The Sofas section allows you to specify the
names of additional subjects of analysis.  This capability and the Sofa Mappings at the bottom are advanced topics,
described in <a class="crossrefText" href="SOFA_Developers_Guide.htm#_crossRef286">Chapter
8, <b><i>Annotations, Artifacts, and Sofas</i></b></a><a class="crossrefPage" href="SOFA_Developers_Guide.htm#_crossRef286"></a></p>

<p>This is all of the information we need to provide for a
simple annotator.  If you want to peek at
the XML that this tool saves you from having to write, click on the
&quot;Source&quot; tab at the bottom to view the generated XML.</p>

<h3><a id="_crossRef8">Testing Your Annotator</a></h3>

<p>Having developed an annotator, we need a way to try it out
on some example documents.  The UIMA SDK
includes a tool called the Document Analyzer that will allow us to do
this.  To run the Document Analyzer,
execute the documentAnalyzer shell script that is in the bin directory of your
UIMA SDK installation, or, if you are using the example Eclipse project,
execute the &quot;UIMA Document Analyzer&quot; run configuration supplied with
that project.  (To do this, click on the
menu bar Run &gt; Run ... &gt; and under Java Applications in the left box,
click on UIMA Document Analyzer.)</p>

<p>You should see a screen that looks like this:</p>

<p><img alt="" width="576" height="294"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image014.jpg"/></p>

<p>There are six options on this screen:</p>

<ol><li>Directory containing documents to
analyze</li>


<li>Directory where analysis results
will be written</li>


<li>The XML descriptor for the Analysis
Engine (TAE) you want to run</li>


<li>(Optional) an XML tag, within the
input documents, that contains the text to be analyzed.  For example, the value TEXT would cause the
TAE to only analyze the portion of the document enclosed within &lt;TEXT&gt;...&lt;/TEXT&gt;
tags.</li>


<li>Language of the document </li>


<li>Character encoding
</li></ol>

<p>Use the Browse button next to the 3<sup>rd</sup> item to
set the &quot;Location of TAE XML Descriptor&quot; field to the descriptor
we've just been discussing &ndash; <code>uima/docs/examples/descriptors/tutorial/ex1/RoomNumberAnnotator.xml</code>.  Set the other fields to the values shown in
the screen shot above (which should be the default values if this is the first
time you've run the Document Analyzer).  Then click the &quot;Run&quot; button to start processing.</p>

<p>When processing completes, an &quot;Analysis Results&quot;
window should appear.  </p>

<p><img alt="" width="332" height="255"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image016.jpg"/></p>

<p>Make sure &quot;Java Viewer&quot; is selected as the
Results Display Format, and <b>double-click</b> on the document
UIMASummerSchool2003.txt to view the annotations that were discovered.  The view should look something like this:</p>

<p><img alt="" width="510" height="389"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image018.jpg"/></p>

<p>You can click the mouse on one of the highlighted
annotations to see a list of all its features in the frame on the right.</p>

<ul class="note"><li>The legend will only show
those types which have at least one instance in the CAS, and are declared as
outputs in the capabilities section of the descriptor (see <b><a class="crossrefText" href="Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide.htm#_crossRef7">Creating
the XML Descriptor</a></b> <a class="crossrefPage" href="Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide.htm#_crossRef7"></a>).
</li></ul>

<p>You can use the DocumentAnalyzer to test any UIMA annotator
&ndash; just make sure that the annotator's classes are in the class path.</p>




  </subsection>
<subsection name="Configuration and Logging"><a id="_crossRef9"> </a>



<h3><a id="_crossRef10">Configuration Parameters</a></h3>

<p>The example
RoomNumberAnnotator from the previous section used hardcoded regular
expressions and location names, which is obviously not very flexible.  For example, there is actually a third Watson
building &ndash; Hawthorne II &ndash; whose room numbers are not detected by our annotator.  Rather than add a new hardcoded regular
expression, a better solution is to use configuration parameters.  </p>

<p>UIMA allows annotators
to declare configuration parameters in their descriptors.  The descriptor also specifies default values
for the parameters, though these can be overridden at runtime.</p>

<h4><a id="_crossRef11">Declaring Parameters in the Descriptor</a></h4>

<p>The example
descriptor <code>descriptors/tutoria</code><code>l/ex2/RoomNumberAnnotator.xml</code>
is the same as the descriptor from the previous section except that information
has been filled in for the Parameters and Parameter Settings pages of the
Component Descriptor Editor.</p>

<p>First, in Eclipse,
open example 2's RoomNumberAnnotator in the Component Descriptor Editor, and
then go to the Parameters page (click on the parameters tab at the bottom of
the window), which is shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" width="538" height="364"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image020.jpg"/></p>

<p>Two parameters &ndash;
Patterns and Locations -- have been declared.  In this screen shot, the mouse (not shown) is hovering over Patterns to
show its description in the small popup window.  Every parameter has the following information associated with it:</p>

<ul><li>name &ndash; the name by which the annotator code refers to the
parameter</li>


<li>description &ndash; a natural language description of the
intent of the parameter</li>


<li>type &ndash; the data type of the parameter's value &ndash; must be
one of String, Integer,
Float, or Boolean.</li>


<li>multiValued &ndash; true if the parameter
can take multiple-values (an array), false if the parameter takes only a single
value.   Shown above as <code>Multi</code>.</li>


<li>mandatory &ndash; true if a value must be
provided for the parameter. Shown above as <code>Req</code> (for required).
</li></ul>

<p>Both of our
parameters are mandatory and accept an array of Strings as their value.</p>

<p>Next, default
values are assigned to the parameters on the Parameter Settings page:</p>

<p><img alt="" width="538" height="364"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image022.jpg"/></p>

<p>Here the
&quot;Patterns&quot; parameter is selected, and the right pane shows the list
of values for this parameter, in this case the regular expressions that match
rooms in each of the IBM
 T.J. Watson Research Center buildings.  Notice the third pattern is new, for matching the style of room numbers
in the third building, which has room numbers such as <code>J2-A11</code>.</p>

<h4><a id="_crossRef12">Accessing Parameter Values from the Annotator
Code</a></h4>

<p>The class <code>com.ibm.uima.tutorial.ex2.RoomNumberAnnotato</code><code>r</code> has overridden
the initialize method.  The initialize
method is called by the UIMA framework when the annotator is instantiated, so
it is a good place to read configuration parameter values.  The default initialize method does nothing
with configuration parameters, so you have to override it.  To see the code in Eclipse, switch to the src
folder, and open <code>com.ibm.uima.tutorial.ex2</code>.  Here is the method body:</p>

<p class="xmp">  /**
   * @see BaseAnnotator#initialize(AnnotatorContext)
   */
  public void initialize(AnnotatorContext aContext)
    throws AnnotatorInitializationException, AnnotatorConfigurationException
  {
    // invoke the standard initialization
    // This saves the value of aContext in a field and makes
    // it available via the getContext() method of the superclass
    super.initialize(aContext);
    try
    {
      //Get config. parameter values
      String[] patternStrings = 
        (String[])aContext.getConfigParameterValue(&quot;Patterns&quot;);
      mLocations =
        (String[])aContext.getConfigParameterValue(&quot;Locations&quot;);     </p>

<p class="xmp">      //compile regular expressions</p>

<p class="xmp">      mPatterns = new Pattern[patternStrings.length];
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; patternStrings.length; i++)
      {
        mPatterns[i] = Pattern.compile(patternStrings[i]);  
      }  
    }</p>

<p class="xmp">    catch(AnnotatorContextException e)
    {
      throw new AnnotatorInitializationException(e);    
    }    
  }</p>

<p>The first two
lines inside the try block are where the configuration parameter values are
retrieved.  Configuration parameter
values are accessed through the AnnotatorContext.  As you will see in subsequent sections of
this chapter, the AnnotatorContext is the annotator's access point for all of
the facilities provided by the UIMA framework &ndash; for example logging and
external resource access.</p>

<p>The
AnnotatorContext.getConfigParameterValue method takes the name of the parameter
as an argument; this must match one of the parameters declared in the
descriptor.  The return value of this
method is Object, so it is up to the annotator to cast it to the appropriate
type, String[] in this case.</p>

<p>If there is a
problem retrieving the parameter values, the AnnotatorContext could throw an
AnnotatorContextException.  Generally annotators
would just catch this exception and rethrow it as an
AnnotatorInitializationException, which is what our example annotator does.</p>

<p>To see the
configuration parameters working, run the Document Analyzer application and
select the descriptor <code>docs/exa</code><code>mples/descriptors/tutorial/ ex2/RoomNumberAnnotator.xml</code>.  In the example document <code>WatsonConferenceRooms.txt</code>,
you should see some examples of Hawthorne II room numbers that would not have
been detected by the ex1 version of RoomNumberAnnotator.</p>

<h4><a id="_crossRef13">Supporting Reconfiguration</a></h4>

<p>If you take a look
at the JavaDocs (located in the <a href="api/index.html">docs/api</a> directory) for <code>com.ibm.uima.analysis_engine.Annotator.BaseAnnotator</code>
(which our annotator implements indirectly through JTextAnnotator_ImplBase),
you will see that there is a reconfigure() method, which is called by the
containing application through the UIMA framework, if the configuration
parameter values are changed.</p>

<p>The
JTextAnnotator_ImplBase class provides a default implementation that just calls
the annotator's destroy method followed by its initialize method.  This works fine for our annotator.  The only situation in which you might want to
override the default reconfigure() is if your annotator has very expensive
initialization logic, and you don't want to reinitialize everything if just one
configuration parameter has changed.  In
that case, you can provide a more intelligent implementation of reconfigure()
for your annotator.</p>

<h4><a id="_crossRef14">Configuration Parameter Groups</a></h4>

<p>For annotators
with many sets of configuration parameters, UIMA supports organizing them into
groups.  It is possible to define a
parameter with the same name in multiple groups; one common use for this is for
annotators that can process documents in several languages and which want to
have different parameter settings for the different languages.</p>

<p>The syntax for
defining parameter groups in your descriptor is fairly straightforward &ndash; see <a class="crossrefText" href="Component_Descriptor_Reference.htm#_crossRef120">Chapter 23  </a> for
details.  Values of parameters defined
within groups are accessed through the two-argument version of <code>AnnotatorContext.getConfigParameterValue</code>,
which takes both the group name and the parameter name as its arguments.      </p>

<h3><a id="_crossRef15">Logging</a></h3>

<p>The UIMA SDK
provides a logging facility, which is very similar to the
java.util.logging.Logger class that was introduced in Java 1.4.</p>

<p>In the Java
architecture, each logger instance is associated with a name.  By convention, this name is often the fully
qualified class name of the component issuing the logging call.  The name can be referenced in a configuration
file when  specifying which kinds of log
messages to actually log, and where they should go.</p>

<p>The UIMA framework
supports this convention using the <code>AnnotatorContext</code> object.  If you access a logger instance using <code>getContext().getLogger()</code> within an
Annotator, the logger name will be the fully qualified name of the Annotator
implementation class. </p>

<p>Here is an example
from the process method of <code>com.ibm.uima.tutorial.ex2.RoomNumberAnnotator</code>:</p>

<p class="xmp">    getContext().getLogger().log(Level.FINEST,&quot;Found: &quot; + annotation);</p>

<p>The first argument
to the log method is the level of the log output.  Here, a value of FINEST indicates that this
is a highly-detailed tracing message.  While
useful for debugging, it is likely that real applications will not output log
messages at this level, in order to improve their performance.  Other defined levels, from lowest to highest
importance, are FINER, FINE, CONFIG, INFO, WARNING, and SEVERE.</p>

<p>If no logging
configuration file is provided (see next section), the Java Virtual Machine
defaults would be used, which typically set the level to INFO and higher
messages, and direct output to the console.  </p>

<p>If you specify the
standard UIMA SDK <code>Logger.properties,</code> the output will be directed to a file
named uima.log, in the current working directory (often the &quot;project&quot;
directory when running from Eclipse, for instance).  </p>

<p>Eclipse
Note:  The uima.log file, if written into
the Eclipse workspace in the project uima_examples, for example, may not appear
in the Eclipse package explorer view until you right-click the uima_examples
project with the mouse, and select &quot;Refresh&quot;.  This operation refreshes the Eclipse display
to conform to what may have changed on the file system.</p>

<h4>Specifying the Logging Configuration</h4>

<p>The standard UIMA
logger uses the underlying Java 1.4 logging mechanism.  You can use the APIs that come with that to
configure the logging.  In addition, the
Java 1.4 logging initialization look for a Java System Property named <code>java.util.logging.config.file</code>
and if found, will use the value of this property as the name of a standard
&quot;properties&quot; file, for setting the logging level.  Please refer to the Java 1.4. documentation
for more information on the format and use of this file.</p>

<p>Two sample logging
specification property files can be found in the UIMA_HOME directory:  <code>Logger.properties</code>, and <code>FileConsoleLogger.properties</code>.  These specify the same logging, except the
first logs just to a file, while the second logs both to a file and to the
console. You can edit these files, or create additional ones, as described
below, to change the logging behavior.  </p>

<p>When running your
own Java application, you can specify the location of the logging configuration
file on your Java command line by setting the Java system property <a id="_crossRef16"><code>java.util.logging.config.file</code></a><code> </code>to be the
logging configuration filename.  This
file specification can be either absolute or relative to the working
directory.  For example:</p>

<p class="xmp">java &quot;-Djava.util.logging.config.file=C:/Program Files/apache/uima/Logger.properties&quot;</p>

<ul class="note"><li>In a shell script, you can use environment variables such as UIMA_HOME
if convenient.
</li></ul>

<p>If you are using
Eclipse to launch your application, you can set this property in the VM
arguments section of the Arguments tab of the run configuration screen.  If you've set an environment variable
UIMA_HOME, you could for example, use the string:<br/>
 <code>&quot;-Djava.util.logging.config.file=${env_var:UIMA_HOME}/Logger.properties&quot;.</code></p>

<h4>Setting Logging Levels</h4>

<p>Within the logging
control file, the default global logging level specifies which kinds of events
are logged across all loggers.  For any
given facility this global level can be overridden by a facility specific
level. Multiple handlers are supported.  This allows messages to be directed to a log file, as well as to a
&quot;console&quot;.  Note that the
ConsoleHandler also has a separate level setting to limit messages printed to
the console.  For example:</p>

<p class="xmp">.level= INFO</p>

<p>The properties
file can change where the log is written, as well. </p>

<p>Facility specific
properties allow different logging for each class, as well. For example, to set
the com.xyz.foo logger to only log SEVERE messages:</p>

<p class="xmp">com.xyz.foo.level = SEVERE</p>

<p>If you have a
sample annotator in the package com.ibm.uima.SampleAnnotator you can set the
log level by specifying:</p>

<p class="xmp">com.ibm.uima.SampleAnnotator.level = ALL</p>

<p>There are other
logging controls; for a full discussion, please read the contents of the <code>Logger.properties</code>
file and the Java specification for logging in Java 1.4.</p>

<h4>Format of logging output</h4>

<p>The logging output
is formatted by handlers specified in the properties file for configuring
logging, described above.  The default
formatter that comes with the UIMA SDK formats logging output as follows:</p>

<p><code>Timestamp - threadID: sourceInfo: Message level: message</code></p>

<p> Here's an example:</p>

<p> <code>7/12/04</code><code> 2:15:35 PM - 10:
com.ibm.uima.util.TestClass.main(62): INFO: You are not logged in!</code></p>

<h4>Meaning of the logging severity levels</h4>

<p>These levels are
defined by the Java logging framework, which was incorporated into Java as of
the 1.4 release level.  The levels are
defined in the JavaDocs for java.util.logging.Level, and include both logging
and tracing levels:</p>

<ul class="compact"><li>OFF is a special level that can be used to turn off logging. </li>


<li>ALL indicates that all messages should be logged. </li>


<li>CONFIG is a message level for configuration messages.  These would typically occur once (during
configuration) in methods like <code>initialize()</code>. </li>


<li>INFO is a message level for informational messages, for example,
connected to server IP: 192.168.120.12 </li>


<li>WARNING is a message level indicating a potential problem.</li>


<li>SEVERE is a message level indicating a serious failure.<br/>
<br/>
Tracing levels, typically used for debugging:</li>


<li>FINE is a message level providing tracing information, typically at a
collection level (messages occurring once per collection). </li>


<li>FINER indicates a fairly detailed tracing message, typically at a
document level (once per document).</li>


<li>FINEST indicates a highly detailed tracing message. 
</li></ul>

<h4>Using the logger outside of an annotator</h4>

<p>An application
using UIMA may want to log its messages using the same logging framework.  This can be done by getting a reference to
the UIMA logger, as follows:</p>

<p><code>Logger logger = UIMAFramework.getLogger(TestClass.class);</code></p>

<p>The optional class
argument allows filtering by class (if the log handler supports this).  If not specified, the name of the returned
logger instance is &quot;com.ibm.uima&quot;.</p>

<subsection name="Building Aggregate Analysis Engines"><a id="_crossRef17"> </a>



<h3><a id="_crossRef18">Combining Annotators</a></h3>

<p>The UIMA SDK makes
it very easy to combine any sequence of Analysis Engines to form an <i>Aggregate
Analysis Engine</i>.  This is done
through an XML descriptor; no Java code is required!</p>

<p>If you go to the <code>docs/examples/descriptors/tutorial/ex3</code>
folder (in Eclipse, it's in your uima_examples project, under the <code>descriptors/tutorial/ex3</code>
folder), you will find a descriptor for a TutorialDateTime annotator.  This annotator detects dates and times (and
also sentences and words).  To see what
this annotator can do, try it out using the Document Analyzer.  If you are curious as to how this annotator
works, the source code is included, but it is not necessary to understand the
code at this time.</p>

<p>We are going to
combine the TutorialDateTime annotator with the RoomNumberAnnotator to create
an aggregate Analysis Engine.  This is
illustrated in  <a class="figReference" href="#_crossRef19">Figure nnn</a>. <img alt="" width="560" height="320"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image024.png"/>
<a class="figCaption" id="_crossRef19">Combining Annotators to form
     and Aggregate Analysis Engine</a>
The
descriptor that does this is named <code>RoomNumberAndDateTime.xml</code>, which you can open in the
Component Descriptor Editor plug-in.  This is in the uima_examples project in the folder <code>descriptors/tutorial/ex3</code>.
</p>

<p>The
&quot;Aggregate&quot; page of the Component Descriptor Editor is used to define
which components make up the aggregate.  A screen shot is shown below.  (If
you are not using Eclipse, see <i>Section </i><a class="crossrefText" href="Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide.htm#_crossRef36">4.8, <b>Introduction to
Analysis Engine Descriptor XML Syntax</b></a> for the actual XML syntax for Aggregate
Analysis Engine Descriptors.)</p>

<p><img alt="" width="575" height="357"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image026.jpg"/></p>

<p>On the left side
of the screen is the list of component engines that make up the aggregate &ndash; in
this case, the TutorialDateTime annotator and the RoomNumberAnnotator.  To add a component, you can click the
&quot;Add&quot; button and browse to its descriptor.  You can also click the &quot;Find AE&quot;
button and search for an Analysis Engine in your Eclipse workspace.  </p>

<ul class="note"><li>The
&quot;AddRemote&quot; button is used for adding components which run remotely
(for example, on another machine using a remote networking connection).  This capability is described in section <a class="crossrefText" href="Application_Developers_Guide.htm#_crossRef67">6.6.3, <b><i>How
to Call a UIMA Service</i></b></a> <a class="crossrefPage" href="Application_Developers_Guide.htm#_crossRef67"></a>.
</li></ul>

<p>The order of the
components in the left pane does not imply an order of execution.  The order of execution, or &quot;flow&quot;
is determined in the &quot;Component Engine Flow&quot; section on the
right.  UIMA supports different types of
algorithms (possibly dynamic) for determining the flow.  Here we pick the simplest: <code>FixedFlow</code>. We
have chosen to have the RoomNumberAnnotator execute first, although in this
case it doesn't really matter, since the RoomNumber and DateTime annotators do
not have any dependencies on one another.  </p>

<p>If you look at the
&quot;Type System&quot; page of the Component Descriptor Editor, you will see
that it displays the type system but is not editable.  The Type System of an Aggregate Analysis
Engine is automatically computed by merging the Type Systems of each of its
components.</p>

<p>The Capabilities
page is where you explicitly declare the aggregate Analysis Engine's inputs and
outputs.  Sofas and Languages are
described later.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="526" height="386"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image028.jpg"/></p>

<p>Note that it is
not automatically assumed that all outputs of each component Analysis Engine
(AE) are passed through as outputs of the aggregate AE.  In this case, for example, we have decided to
suppress the Word and Sentence annotations that are produced by the
TutorialDateTime annotator.  </p>

<p>You can run this
AE using the Document Analyzer in the same way that you run any other AE.  Just select the <code>docs/examples/descriptors/tutorial/ex3/
RoomNumberAndDateTime.xml</code> descriptor and click the Run button.  You should see that RoomNumbers, Dates, and
Times are all shown but that Words and Sentences are not:</p>

<p><img alt="" width="525" height="468"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image030.jpg"/></p>

<h3><a id="_crossRef20">Aggregate Engines can also contain
CAS Consumers</a></h3>

<p>In addition to aggregating Analysis Engines,
Aggregates can also contain CAS Consumers (see <b><a class="crossrefText" href="CPE_Developers_Guide.htm#_crossRef194">Developing CAS Consumers</a></b> on page <b><i>5-122</i></b>), or even a mixture of
these components.  The UIMA Examples has
an example of an Aggregate which contains both an analysis engine and a CAS
consumer, in <code>docs/examples/descriptors/MixedAggregate.xml.</code></p>

<h3><a id="_crossRef21">Reading the Results of Previous
Annotators</a></h3>

<p>So far, we have
been looking at annotators that look directly at the document text.  However, annotators can also use the results
of other annotators.  One useful thing we
can do at this point is look for the co-occurrence of a Date, a RoomNumber, and
two Times &ndash; and annotate that as a Meeting. </p>

<p>The JCas maintains
<i>indexes</i> of annotations, and from an index you can obtain an iterator
that allows you to step through all annotations of a particular type.  Here's some example code that would iterate
over all of the TimeAnnot annotations in the JCas:</p>

<p class="xmp">JFSIndexRepository indexes = aJCas.getJFSIndexRepository();
FSIndex timeIndex = indexes.getAnnotationIndex(TimeAnnot.type);
Iterator timeIter = timeIndex.iterator();   
while (timeIter.hasNext())
{
  TimeAnnot time = (TimeAnnot)timeIter.next();

  //do something
}</p>

<p>Now that we've
explained the basics, let's take a look at the process method for <code>com.ibm.uima.tutorial.ex4.MeetingAnnotator</code>.  Since we're looking for a combination of a
RoomNumber, a Date, and two Times, there are four nested iterators.  (There's surely a better algorithm for doing
this, but to keep things simple we're just going to look at every combination
of the four items.)</p>

<p>For each
combination of the four annotations, we compute the span of text that includes
all of them, and then we check to see if that span is smaller than a
&quot;window&quot; size, a configuration parameter.  There are also some checks to make sure that
we don't annotate the same span of text multiple times.  If all the checks pass, we create a Meeting
annotation over the whole span.  There's
really nothing to it!</p>

<p>The XML
descriptor, located in <code>docs/examples/descriptors/tutorial/ex4/</code><code>MeetingAnnotator.xml</code>,
is also very straightforward.  An
important difference from previous descriptors is that this is the first annotator
we've discussed that has input requirements.   This can be seen on the &quot;Capabilities&quot; page of the Component
Descriptor Editor:</p>

<p><img alt="" width="526" height="416"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image032.jpg"/></p>

<p>If we were to run
the MeetingAnnotator on its own, it wouldn't detect anything because it
wouldn't have any input annotations to work with.  The required input annotations can be
produced by the RoomNumber and DateTime annotators.  So, we create an aggregate Analysis Engine
containing these two annotators, followed by the Meeting annotator.  This aggregate is illustrated in <a class="figReference" href="#_crossRef22">Figure 9</a>. The descriptor for this is in <code>docs/examples/descriptors/tutorial/ex4/MeetingDetectorTAE.xml</code>.  Give it a try in the Document Analyzer. <img alt="" width="555" height="232"

<h3><a id="_crossRef25">Contract for Annotator methods
called by the Framework</a></h3>

<p>Every instance of an Annotator is associated
with one and only one thread.  An
instance never has to worry about running some method on one thread, and then
asynchronously being called using another thread.  This approach simplifies the design of
annotators &ndash; they do not have to be designed to support multi-threading.  When multiple threading is wanted, for
performance, multiple instances of the Annotator are created, each one running
on just one thread.</p>

<p>The following table defines the methods called
by the framework, when they are called, and the requirements annotator
implementations must follow.</p>

<table>
 <tr>

  Collection Processing application, the CPM calls the process method.  If the application creates and manages your
  own Collection Processing Engine via API calls (see JavaDocs), the
  application calls this on the Collection Processing Engine, and it is
  delegated by the framework to the components.</p>

  <p>An annotator should release all resources,

<h3><a id="_crossRef26">Reporting errors from Annotators</a></h3>

<p>There
are two broad classes of errors that can occur: recoverable an
unrecoverable.  Because Annotators are
often expected to process very large numbers of artifacts (for example, text
documents), they should be written to recover where possible.</p>

<p>For
example, if an upstream annotator created some input for an annotator which is
invalid, the annotator may want to log this event, ignore the bad input and
continue.  It may include a notification
of this event in the CAS, for further downstream annotators to consider.  Or, it may throw an exception (see next
section) &ndash; but in this case, it cannot do any further processing on that
document.</p>

<ul class="note"><li>The
choice of what to do can be made configurable, using the configuration
parameters.   
</li></ul>

<h3><a id="_crossRef27">Throwing Exceptions from
Annotators</a></h3>

<p>Let's say an invalid regular expression was passed as a
parameter to the RoomNumberAnnotator.  Because
this is an error related to the overall configuration, and not something we
could expect to ignore, we should throw an appropriate exception, and most Java
programmers would expect to do so like this:</p>

<p class="xmp">throw new AnnotatorConfigurationException(&quot;The regular expression &quot; + x + &quot; is not valid.&quot;);</p>

<p>UIMA, however, does not do it this way.  All UIMA exceptions are <i>internationalized</i>,
meaning that they support translation into other languages.  This is accomplished by eliminating hardcoded
message strings and instead using external message digests.  Message digests are files containing (key,
value) pairs.  The key is used in the
Java code instead of the actual message string.  This allows the message string to be easily translated later by
modifying the message digest file, not the Java code.  Also, message strings in the digest can
contain parameters that are filled in when the exception is thrown.  The format of the message digest file is
described in the JavaDocs for the Java class <code>java.util.PropertyResourceBundler</code>
and in the load method of <code>java.util.Properties</code>.</p>

<p>The first thing an annotator developer must choose is what
Exception class to use.  There are three
to choose from:</p>

<ol><li>AnnotatorConfigurationException
should be thrown from the annotator's initialize() method if invalid
configuration parameter values have been specified.</li>


<li>AnnotatorInitializationException
should be thrown from the annotator's initialize() method if initialization
fails for some other reason.</li>


<li>AnnotatorProcessException should
be thrown from the annotator's process() method if the processing of a
particular document fails for any reason.
</li></ol>

<p>Generally you will not need to define your own custom
exception classes, but if you do they must extend one of these three classes,
which are the only types of Exceptions that the annotator interface permits annotators
to throw.</p>

<p>All of the UIMA Exception classes share common Constructor
varieties.  There are four possible
arguments:</p>

<p>The name of the message digest to
use (optional &ndash; if not specified the default UIMA message digest is used).</p>

<p>The key string used to select the
message in the message digest.</p>

<p>An object array containing the
parameters to include in the message.  Messages can have substitutable parts.  When the message is given, the string representation of the objects
passed are substituted into the message.  The object array is often created using the syntax new Object[]{x, y}. </p>

<p>Another exception which is the
&quot;cause&quot; of the exception you are throwing.  This feature is commonly used when you catch
another exception and rethrow it. (optional)</p>

<p>If you look at source file (folder: src in Eclipse) <code>com.ibm.uima.tutorial.ex5.RoomNumberAnnotator</code>, you will
see the following code:</p>

<p class="xmp">Try
{
  mPatterns[i] = Pattern.compile(patternStrings[i]);  
}
catch(PatternSyntaxException e)
{
  throw new AnnotatorConfigurationException(
     MESSAGE_DIGEST, &quot;regex_syntax_error&quot;, 
     new Object[]{patternStrings[i]}, e);
}</p>

<p>where the MESSAGE_DIGEST constant has the value <code>&quot;com.ibm.uima.tutorial.ex5.RoomNumberAnnotator_Messages&quot;.</code></p>

<p>Message digests are specified using a dotted name, just
like Java classes.  This file, with the
.properties extension, must be present in the class path.  In Eclipse, you find this file under the src
folder, in the package com.ibm.uima.tutorial.ex5, with the name
RoomNumberAnnotator_Messages.properties.  Outside of Eclipse, you can find this in the <code>uima_examples.jar</code>
with the name <code>com/ibm/uima/tutorial/ex5/RoomNumberAnnotator_Messages.properties.</code>  If you look in this file you will see the
line: </p>

<p class="xmp">regex_syntax_error = {0} is not a valid regular expression.</p>

<p>which is the error message for the example exception we
showed above. The placeholder {0} will be filled by the toString() value of the
argument passed to the exception constructor &ndash; in this case, the regular
expression pattern that didn't compile.  If there were additional arguments, their locations in the message would
be indicated as {1}, {2}, and so on.   </p>

<p>If a message digest is not specified in the call to the
exception constructor, the default is <code>UIMAException.STANDARD_MESSAGE_CATALOG</code>
(whose value is &quot;<code>com.ibm.uima.UIMAException_Messages</code>&quot;
in the current release but may change).   This message digest is located in the <code>uima_core.jar</code>
file at <code>com/ibm/uima/UIMAException_messages.properties</code>
&ndash; you can take a look to see if any of these exception messages are useful to
use.</p>

<p>To try out the regex_syntax_error exception, just use the
Document Analyzer to run <code>docs/examples/descriptors/tutorial/ex5/RoomNumberAnnotator.xml</code>,
which happens to have an invalid regular expression in its configuration
parameter settings.</p>

<p>To summarize, here are the steps to take if you want to
define your own exception message:</p>

<p>Create a file with the .properties
extension, where you declare message keys and their associated messages, using
the same syntax as shown above for the regex_syntax_error exception.  The properties file syntax is more completely
described in the JavaDocs for the <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load(java.io.InputStream)">load</a>
method of the java.util.Properties class.</p>

<p>Put your properties file somewhere
in your class path (it can be in your annotator&rsquo;s .jar file).</p>

<p>Define a String constant (called
MESSAGE_DIGEST for example) in your annotator code whose value is the dotted
name of this properties file.  For
example, if your properties file is inside your jar file at the location <code>org/myorg/myannotator/Messages.properties</code>, then this
String constant should have the value <code>org.myorg.myannotator.Messages</code>.  Do not include the .properties
extension.  In Java Internationalization
terminology, this is called the Resource Bundle name.  For more information see the JavaDocs for the
<a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/util/PropertyResourceBundle.html">PropertyResourceBundle</a>
class. </p>

<p>In your annotator code,
throw an exception like this:<br/>
<br/>
<code>throw new
AnnotatorConfigurationException(MESSAGE_DIGEST, &quot;your_message_name&quot;,new
Object[]{param1,param2,...});</code></p>

<p>You may also wish to look at the JavaDocs for the
UIMAException class.</p>

<p>For more information on Java's internationalization
features, see the Java Internationalization Guide at <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/intl/index.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/intl/index.html</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="_crossRef28">Accessing External Resource Files</a></h3>

<p>Sometimes you may want an annotator to read from an
external file &ndash; for example, a long list of keys and values that you are going
to build into a HashMap.  You could, of
course, just introduce a configuration parameter that holds the absolute path
to this resource file, and build the HashMap in your annotator's initialize
method.  However, this is not the best
solution for three reasons:</p>

<ol><li>Including an absolute path in your
descriptor makes your annotator difficult for others to use.  Each user will need to edit this descriptor
and set the absolute path to a value appropriate for his or her installation.</li>


<li>You cannot share the HashMap
between multiple annotators.  Also, in
some deployment scenarios there may be more than one instance of your annotator,
and you would like to have the option for them to use the same HashMap
instance.</li>


<li>Your annotator would become
dependent on a particular data representation &ndash; the word list would have to
come from a file on the local disk and it would have to be in a particular
format.  It would be better if this were
decoupled.
</li></ol>

<p>A better way to access external resource is through the
ResourceManager component.  In this
section we are going to show an example of how to use the Resource
Manager.  </p>

<p>This example annotator will annotate UIMA acronyms (e.g.
UIMA, TAE, CAS, JCas) and store the acronym's expanded form as a feature of the
annotation.  The acronyms and their
expanded forms are stored in an external file.</p>

<p>First, look at the <code>docs/examples/descriptors/tutorial/ex6/
UimaAcronymAnnotator.xm</code><code>l</code> descriptor. </p>

<p><img alt="" width="576" height="446"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image036.jpg"/></p>

<p>The values of the rows in the two tables are longer than
can be easily shown.  You can click the
small button at the top right to shift the layout from two side-by-side tables,
to a vertically stacked layout.  You can
also click the small twisty on the &quot;Imports for External Resources and
Bindings&quot; to collapse this section, because it's not used.  Then the same screen will appear like this:</p>

<p><img alt="" width="681" height="354"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image038.jpg"/></p>

<p>The top window has a scroll bar allowing you to see the
rest of the line. </p>

<h4>Declaring Resource
Dependencies</h4>

<p>The bottom window is where an annotator declares an external
resource dependency.  The XML for this is
as follows:  </p>

<p class="xmp">&lt;externalResourceDependency&gt;
  &lt;key&gt;AcronymTable&lt;/key&gt; 
  &lt;description&gt;Table of acronyms and their expanded
                forms.&lt;/description&gt; 
  &lt;interfaceName&gt; com.ibm.uima.tutorial.ex6.StringMapResource
  &lt;/interfaceName&gt; 
&lt;/externalResourceDependency&gt;</p>

<p>The &lt;key&gt; value (AcronymTable) is the name by which
the annotator identifies this resource.  The key must be unique for all resources that this annotator accesses,
but the same key could be used by different annotators to mean different
things.  The interface name (<code>com.ibm.uima.tutorial.ex6.StringMapResource</code>) is the Java
interface through which the annotator accesses the data.  Specifying an interface name is
optional.  If you do not specify an
interface name, annotators will get direct access to the data file.</p>

<h4>Accessing the
Resource from the AnnotatorContext</h4>

<p> If you look at the <code>com.ibm.uima</code><code>.tutorial.ex6.UimaAcronymAnnotator</code>
source, you will see that the annotator accesses this resource from the
AnnotatorContext by calling:</p>

<p class="xmp">StringMapResource mMap =
   (StringMapResource)getContext().getResourceObject(&quot;AcronymTable&quot;);</p>

<p>The object returned from the <code>getResourceObject</code>
method will implement the interface declared in the <code>&lt;interfaceName&gt;</code>
section of the descriptor, <code>StringMapResource</code> in
this case.  The annotator code does not
need to know the location of the data nor the Java class that is being used to
read the data and implement the <code>StringMapResource</code>
interface.</p>

<p>Note that if we did not specify a Java interface in our
descriptor, our annotator could directly access the resource data as follows:</p>

<p class="xmp">InputStream stream = getContext().getResourceAsStream(&quot;AcronymTable&quot;);</p>

<p>If necessary, the annotator could also determine the
location of the resource file, by calling:</p>

<p class="xmp">URL url = getContext().getResourceURL(&quot;AcronymTable&quot;);</p>

<p>These last two options are only available in the case
where the descriptor does not declare a Java interface.</p>

<h4>Declaring
Resources and Bindings</h4>

<p>Refer back to the top window in the Resources page of the
Component Descriptor Editor.  This is
where we specify the location of the resource data, and the Java class used to
read the data.  For the example, this
corresponds to the following section of the descriptor:</p>

<p class="xmp">&lt;resourceManagerConfiguration&gt;
  &lt;externalResources&gt;
    &lt;externalResource&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;UimaAcronymTableFile&lt;/name&gt; 
      &lt;description&gt;
         A table containing UIMA acronyms and their expanded forms.
      &lt;/description&gt; 
      &lt;fileResourceSpecifier&gt;
        &lt;fileUrl&gt;file:com/ibm/uima/tutorial/ex6/uimaAcronyms.txt
        &lt;/fileUrl&gt; 
      &lt;/fileResourceSpecifier&gt;
      &lt;implementationName&gt;
         com.ibm.uima.tutorial.ex6.StringMapResource_impl
      &lt;/implementationName&gt; 
    &lt;/externalResource&gt;
  &lt;/externalResources&gt;</p>

<p class="xmp"></p>

<p class="xmp">  &lt;externalResourceBindings&gt;
    &lt;externalResourceBinding&gt;
      &lt;key&gt;AcronymTable&lt;/key&gt;    
      &lt;resourceName&gt;UimaAcronymTableFile&lt;/resourceName&gt; 
    &lt;/externalResourceBinding&gt;
  &lt;/externalResourceBindings&gt;
&lt;/resourceManagerConfiguration&gt;</p>

<p>The first section of this XML declares an
externalResource, the <code>UimaAcronymTableFile</code>.  With this, the fileUrl element specifies the
path to the data file.  This can be an
absolute URL (e.g. one that starts with file:/ or file:///, or
file://my.host.org/), but that is not recommended because it makes installation
of your component more difficult, as noted earlier.  Better is a relative URL, which will be
looked up within the classpath (and/or datapath), as used in this example.  In this case, the file <code>com/ibm/uima/tutorial/ex6/uimaAcronyms.txt</code>
is located in <code>uima_examples</code><code>.jar</code>,
which is in the classpath.  If you look
in this file you will see the definitions of several UIMA acronyms.</p>

<p>The second section of the XML declares an
externalResourceBinding, which connects the key <code>AcronymTable</code>,
declared in the annotator&rsquo;s external resource dependency, to the actual
resource name <code>UimaAcronymTableFile</code>.  This is rather trivial in this case; for more
on bindings see the example <code>UimaMeetingDetectorTAE.xml</code>
below.  There is no global repository for
external resources; it is up to the user to define each resource needed by a
particular set of annotators.    </p>

<p>In the Component Descriptor Editor, bindings are indicated
below the external resource.  To create a
new binding, you select an external resource (which must have previously been
defined), and an external resource dependency, and then click the <code>Bind</code> button, which only enables if you have selected two
things to bind together.</p>

<p>When the Analysis Engine is initialized, it creates a
single instance of <code>StringMapResource_impl</code> and loads
it with the contents of the data file.  The UimaAcronymAnnotator then accesses the data through the <code>StringMapResource</code> interface.  This single instance could be shared among
multiple annotators, as will be explained later.</p>

<p>Note that all resource implementation classes (e.g. StringMapResource_impl
in the provided example) need to be public and have public, 0-argument
constructors, so that they can be instantiated by the framework.   (Although Java classes in which you do not
define any constructor will, by default, have a 0-argument constructor that
doesn't do anything, a class in which you have defined at least one constructor
does not get a default 0-argument constructor.)</p>

<p>This annotator is illustrated in <a class="figReference" href="#_crossRef29">Figure 10</a>. To see it in action, just run it using the Document
Analyzer.  When it finishes, open up the
UIMA_Seminars document in the  processed
results window, (double-click it), and then left-click on one of the
highlighted terms, to see the expandedForm feature's value. <img alt="" width="528" height="352"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image040.png"/>
<a class="figCaption" id="_crossRef29">External Resource Binding</a>
</p>

<p>By designing our annotator in this way, we have gained
some flexibility.  We can freely replace
the StringMapResource_impl class with any other implementation that implements
the simple StringMapResource interface.  (For example, for very large resources we might not be able to have the
entire map in memory.)  We have also made
our external resource dependencies explicit in the descriptor, which will help
others to deploy our annotator.</p>

<h4>Sharing Resources
between Annotators</h4>

<p>Another advantage of the Resource Manager is that it
allows our data to be shared between annotators.  To demonstrate this we have developed another
annotator that will use the same acronym table.  The UimaMeetingAnnotator will iterate over Meeting annotations
discovered by the Meeting Detector we previously developed and attempt to
determine whether the topic of the meeting is related to UIMA.  It will do this by looking for occurrences of
UIMA acronyms in close proximity to the meeting annotation.  We could implement this by using the UimaAcronymAnnotator,
of course, but for the sake of this example we will have the
UimaMeetingAnnotator access the acronym map directly.</p>

<p>The Java code for the UimaMeetingAnnotator in example 6
creates a new type, UimaMeeting, if it finds a meeting with 50 characters of
the UIMA acronym.  </p>

<p>We combine three analysis engines, the
UimaAcronymAnnotator to annotate UIMA acronyms, the MeetingDectector from
example 4 to find meetings and finally the UimaMeetingAnnotator to annotate
just meetings about UIMA. Together these are assembled to form the new
aggregate analysis engine, UimaMeetingDectector. This aggregate and the sharing
of a common resource are illustrated in <a class="crossrefText" href="Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide.htm#_crossRef30">Figure
11</a>. <img alt="" width="563" height="320"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image042.png"/>
<a class="figCaption" id="_crossRef30">Component engines of an
     aggregate share a common resource</a>
The important
thing to notice is in the <code>UimaMeetingDetectorTAE.xml</code>
aggregate descriptor.  It includes both
the UimaMeetingAnnotator and the UimaAcronymAnnotator, and contains a single
declaration of the UimaAcronymTableFile resource.  (The actual example has the order of the
first two annotators reversed versus the above picture, which is OK since they
do not depend on one another).</p>

<p>It also binds the resources as follows:</p>

<p><img alt="" width="572" height="504"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image044.jpg"/></p>

<p class="xmp">&lt;externalResourceBindings&gt;
  &lt;externalResourceBinding&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;UimaAcronymAnnotator/AcronymTable&lt;/key&gt; 
    &lt;resourceName&gt;UimaAcronymTableFile&lt;/resourceName&gt; 
  &lt;/externalResourceBinding&gt;

  &lt;externalResourceBinding&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;UimaMeetingAnnotator/UimaTermTable&lt;/key&gt; 
    &lt;resourceName&gt;UimaAcronymTableFile&lt;/resourceName&gt; 
  &lt;/externalResourceBinding&gt;
&lt;/externalResourceBindings&gt;</p>

<p>This binds the resource dependencies of both the
UimaAcronymAnnotator (which uses the name AcronymTable) and
UimaMeetingAnnotator (which uses UimaTermTable) to the single declared resource
named UimaAcronymFile.  Therefore they
will share the same instance.  Resource
bindings in the aggregate descriptor <b><i>override</i></b> any resource
declarations in individual annotator descriptors.</p>

<p>If we wanted to have the annotators use different acronym
tables, we could easily do that.  We
would simply have to change the resourceName elements in the bindings so that
they referred to two different resources.  The Resource Manager gives us the flexibility to make this decision at
deployment time, without changing any Java code.</p>

<h3><a id="_crossRef31">Result Specification Setting</a></h3>

<p>The Result Specification is a parameter passed to all
annotators, as the second argument in the process(...) call. It is a list of
output types and / or type:feature specifications, which are expected to be
&quot;output&quot; from the annotator.  Annotators may use this to optimize their operations, when possible, for
those cases where only particular outputs are wanted.  The interface to the Result Specification
object (see the JavaDocs) allows querying both types and particular features of
types.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can specify the Result Specification;
othertimes, you cannot (for instance, inside a Collection Processing Engine,
you cannot). When you cannot specify it, or choose not to specify it (for
example, using the form of the process(...) call on an Analysis Engine that
doesn't include the Result Specification), a &quot;Default&quot; Result
Specification is used.</p>

<h4>Default Result
Specification</h4>

<p>The default Result Specification is taken from the
Engine's output Capability Specification. Remember that a Capability
Specification has both inputs and outputs, can specify types and / or features,
and there can be more than one Capability Set. If there is more than one set,
the logical union of these sets is used. The default Result Specification is
exactly what's included in the output Capability Specification.</p>

<h4>Passing Result
Specifications to Annotators</h4>

<p>If you are not using aggregation or collection processing,
but instead are instantiating your own primitive analysis engines and calling
their process methods, you can pass whatever Result Specification is appropriate
in your call to process(CAS, ResultSpecification). For primitive engines,
whatever you pass in is passed along as the value of the 2nd argument in the
annotator's process() method. If you use the form of the call without the
Result Specification, the default Result Specification is created and passed,
as above.</p>

<h4>Aggregates</h4>

<p>For aggregate engines, the value passed to the primitive
annotator code depends on the kind of flow.</p>

<h4>Fixed
Flow</h4>

<p>For FixedFlow, any ResultSpecification passed into the
aggregate is ignored, and instead, each primitive annotator is passed a result
spec that corresponds to the union of its output capability specifications at
the primitive descriptor level. If no output capability specification is given,
the annotator will still be called, but the result specification will be empty.</p>

<h4>CapabilityLanguageFlow</h4>

<p>For CapabilityLanguageFlow, each annotator is passed a
ResultSpecification that is the intersection of the primitive annotator's
output Capability Specification with the ResultSpecification passed to the
aggregate. If this intersection is null (the annotator does not produce any
type or feature included in the ResultSpecification), the annotator will not be
called at all.</p>

<p>Therefore, if using the CapabilityLanguageFlow, if you
want to supply a custom ResultSpecification for the aggregate it must include
any intermediate types that need to be produced internally in the flow, or else
things will not work properly.</p>

<h4>Special rule for
skipping Analysis Engines</h4>

<p>When using the CapabilityLanguageFlow, an annotator will
be also be skipped if all of its outputs are in the output capability of some
annotator(s) that has (have) executed previously in the flow. The concept here
is that if all of an annotator's output types have already been produced, that
annotator will not be called.</p>

<p>For an Aggregate, each annotator is passed a Result Specification
that is the intersection of the set of types mentioned in its output with the
Result Specification passed to the aggregate.  If this intersection is null (the annotator does not produce any type
included in the ResultSpecification), the annotator will not be called at all. </p>

<p>Therefore, if using the CapabilityLanguageFlow, if you
want to supply a custom ResultSpecification for the aggregate it must include
any intermediate types that need to be produced, or else things will not work
properly.</p>

<h4>Collection
Processing Engines</h4>

<p>The Default Result Specification is always used for all
components of a Collection Processing Engine.</p>

<h3><a id="_crossRef32">Class path setup when using JCas</a></h3>

<p>JCas provides Java classes that correspond to each CAS
type in an application.  These classes
are generated by the JCasGen utility (which can be automatically invoked from
the Component Descriptor Editor).</p>

<p>The Java source classes generated by the JCasGen utility
are typically compiled and packaged into a JAR file.  This JAR file must be present in the
classpath of the UIMA application.  </p>

<p>More details on issues around setting up this class path,
including deployment issues where class loaders are being used to isolate
multiple UIMA applications inside a single running Java Virtual Machine, please
see <b><a class="crossrefText" href="JCas_Reference.htm#_crossRef242">Class Loaders
in UIMA</a></b> <a class="crossrefPage" href="JCas_Reference.htm#_crossRef242"></a>.</p>

<h3><a id="_crossRef33">Using the Shell Scripts</a></h3>

<p>The SDK includes a /bin subdirectory containing shell
scripts, for Windows (.bat files) and Linux (.sh files).  Many of these scripts invoke sample Java
programs which require a class path.  The
UIMA required files and directories on the class path are set up using the
shell script: <code>setUimaClassPath</code>.</p>

<p>If you need to include files on the class path, the
scripts are set up to add anything you specify in the environment variable
UIMA_CLASSPATH to the classpath.  So, for
example, if you are running the document analyzer, and wanted it to find a Java
class file named (on Windows) c:\a\b\c\myProject\myJarFile.jar, you could first
issue a set command to set the UIMA_CLASSPATH to this file, followed by the
documentAnalyzer script:</p>

<p class="xmp">set UIMA_CLASSPATH=c:abcmyProjectmyJarFile.jar
documentAnalyzer</p>

<p>Other environment variables are used by the shell scripts,
as follows:</p>

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>
  <p>UIMA_HOME</p>
  </td>
  <td>

<subsection name="Common Pitfalls"><a id="_crossRef34"> </a>



<p>Here are some things to avoid doing in your annotator
code:</p>

<p><b>Retaining references to JCas objects between calls to
process()</b></p>

<p>The JCas will be cleared between calls to your annotator's
process() method.  All of the analysis
results related to the previous document will be deleted to make way for
analysis of a new document.  Therefore,
you should never save a reference to a JCas Feature Structure object (i.e. an
instance of a class created using JCasGen) and attempt to reuse it in a future
invocation of the process() method.  If
you do so, the results will be undefined.  </p>

<p><b>Careless use of static data</b></p>

<p>Always keep in mind that an application that uses your
annotator may create multiple instances of your annotator class.  A multithreaded application may attempt to
use two instances of your annotator to process two different documents
simultaneously.  This will generally not
cause any problems as long as your annotator instances do not share static
data.</p>

<p>In general, you should not use static variables other than
static final constants of primitive data types (String, int, float, etc).  Other types of static variables may allow one
annotator instance to set a value that affects another annotator instance,
which can lead to unexpected effects.  Also, static references to classes that aren't thread-safe are likely to
cause errors in multithreaded applications.</p>




  </subsection>
<subsection name="Viewing FeatureStructures in the Eclipse debugger"><a id="_crossRef35"> </a>



<p>Eclipse (as of version 3.1 or later) has a new feature for
viewing Java Logical Structures.  When
enabled, it will permit you to see a view of FeatureStructure objects which
show all of the features.  For example,
here is a view of a FeatureStructure for the RoomNumber annotation, from the
tutorial example 1:</p>

<p><img alt="" width="492" height="171"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image046.jpg"/></p>

<p>The &quot;annotation&quot; object in Java shows as a 2
element object, not very convenient for seeing the features.  But if you turn on the Java Logical Structure
mode by pushing this button:</p>

<p><img alt="" width="480" height="24"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image048.jpg"/></p>

<p>the features of the FeatureStructure instance will be
shown:</p>

<p><img alt="" width="492" height="206"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide_files/image050.jpg"/></p>

<subsection name="Introduction to Analysis Engine Descriptor XML Syntax"><a id="_crossRef36"> </a>



<p>This section is an introduction to the syntax used for
Analysis Engine Descriptors.  Most users
do not need to understand these details; they can use the Component Descriptor
Editor Eclipse plugin to edit Analysis Engine Descriptors rather than editing
the XML directly.</p>

<p>This section walks through the actual XML descriptor for
the RoomNumberAnnotator example introduced in section <a class="crossrefText" href="Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide.htm#_crossRef2">4.1
</a>.  The
discussion is divided into several logical sections of the descriptor.</p>

<p>The full specification for Analysis Engine Descriptors is
defined in <a class="crossrefText" href="Component_Descriptor_Reference.htm#_crossRef120">Chapter 23, <b>Component Descriptor
Reference</b></a></p>

<h3><a id="_crossRef37">Header and Annotator Class
Identification</a></h3>

<p class="xmp">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt; 
&lt;!--  Descriptor for the example RoomNumberAnnotator. --&gt; 
&lt;analysisEngineDescription xmlns=&quot;http://uima.watson.ibm.com/resourceSpecifier&quot;&gt;
  &lt;frameworkImplementation&gt;com.ibm.uima.java&lt;/frameworkImplementation&gt; 
  &lt;primitive&gt;true&lt;/primitive&gt; 
  &lt;annotatorImplementationName&gt;
    com.ibm.uima.tutorial.ex1.RoomNumberAnnotator
  &lt;/annotatorImplementationName&gt; </p>

<p>The document begins with a standard XML header and a
comment.  The root element of the
document is named <code>&lt;analysisEngineDescription&gt;,</code>
and must specify the XML namespace <code>http://uima.watson.ibm.com/resourceSpecifier</code>.  </p>

<p>The first subelement, <code>&lt;frameworkImplementation&gt;</code>,
must contain the value <code>com.ibm.uima.java</code>.  The second subelement, <code>&lt;primitive&gt;</code>,
contains the Boolean value true, indicating that this XML document describes a <i>Primitive</i>
Analysis Engine.  A Primitive Analysis
Engine is comprised of a single annotator.  It is also possible to construct XML descriptors for non-primitive or <i>Aggregate</i>
Analysis Engines; this is covered later.</p>

<p>The next element, <code>&lt;annotatorImplementationName&gt;</code>,
contains the fully-qualified class name of our annotator class.  This is how the UIMA framework determines
which annotator class to instantiate.</p>

<h3><a id="_crossRef38">Simple Metadata Attributes</a></h3>

<p class="xmp">&lt;analysisEngineMetaData&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;Room Number Annotator&lt;/name&gt; 
  &lt;description&gt;An example annotator that searches for room numbers in
     the IBM  Watson research buildings.&lt;/description&gt; 
  &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt; 
  &lt;vendor&gt;IBM&lt;/vendor&gt; </p>

<p class="xmp"></p>

<p>Here are shown four simple metadata fields &ndash; name,
description, version, and vendor.  Providing values for these fields is optional, but recommended.</p>

<h3> <a id="_crossRef39">Type System Definition</a></h3>

<p class="xmp">&lt;typeSystemDescription&gt;
  &lt;imports&gt;
    &lt;import location=&quot;TutorialTypeSystem.xml&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/imports&gt;
&lt;/typeSystemDescription&gt;</p>

<p>This section of the XML descriptor defines which types the
annotator works with.  The recommended
way to do this is to <i>import</i> the type system definition from a separate
file, as shown here.  The location
specified here should be a relative path, and it will be resolved relative to
the location of the aggregate descriptor.  It is also possible to define types directly in the Analysis Engine
descriptor, but these types will not be easily shareable by others.</p>

<h3><a id="_crossRef40">Capabilities</a></h3>

<p class="xmp">&lt;capabilities&gt;
  &lt;capability&gt;
    &lt;inputs /&gt; 
    &lt;outputs&gt;
      &lt;type&gt;com.ibm.uima.tutorial.RoomNumber&lt;/type&gt; 
      &lt;feature&gt;com.ibm.uima.tutorial.RoomNumber:building&lt;/feature&gt; 
    &lt;/outputs&gt;
  &lt;/capability&gt;
&lt;/capabilities&gt;</p>

<p>The last section of the descriptor describes the <i>Capabilities</i>
of the annotator &ndash; the Types/Features it consumes (input) and the
Types/Features that it produces (output).  These must be the names of types and features that exist in the ANALYSIS
ENGINE descriptor&rsquo;s type system definition.</p>

<p>Our annotator outputs only one Type, RoomNumber and one
feature, RoomNumber:building.  The
fully-qualified names (including namespace) are needed.</p>

<p>The building feature is listed separately here, but
clearly specifying every feature for a complex type would be cumbersome.  Therefore, a shortcut syntax exists.  The &lt;outputs&gt; section above could be
replaced with the equivalent section:</p>

<p class="xmp">&lt;outputs&gt;
  &lt;type allAnnotatorFeatures =&quot;true&quot;&gt; com.ibm.uima.tutorial.RoomNumber
  &lt;/type&gt; 
&lt;/outputs&gt;</p>

<h3><a id="_crossRef41">Configuration Parameters
(Optional)</a></h3>

<h4>Configuration
Parameter Declarations</h4>

<p class="xmp">&lt;configurationParameters&gt;
  &lt;configurationParameter&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Patterns&lt;/name&gt; 
    &lt;description&gt;List of room number regular expression patterns.
    &lt;/description&gt; 
    &lt;type&gt;String&lt;/type&gt; 
    &lt;multiValued&gt;true&lt;/multiValued&gt; 
    &lt;mandatory&gt;true&lt;/mandatory&gt; 
  &lt;/configurationParameter&gt;
  &lt;configurationParameter&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Locations&lt;/name&gt; 
    &lt;description&gt;List of locations corresponding to the room number
       expressions specified by the Patterns parameter.
    &lt;/description&gt; 
    &lt;type&gt;String&lt;/type&gt; 
    &lt;multiValued&gt;true&lt;/multiValued&gt; 
    &lt;mandatory&gt;true&lt;/mandatory&gt; 
  &lt;/configurationParameter&gt;
&lt;/configurationParameters&gt;</p>

<p>The <code>&lt;configurationParameters&gt;</code>
element contains the definitions of the configuration parameters that our
annotator accepts.  We have declared two
parameters.  For each configuration
parameter, the following are specified:</p>

<ul><li><b>name</b> &ndash; the name that the
annotator code uses to refer to the parameter</li>


<li><b>description</b> &ndash; a natural
language description of the intent of the parameter</li>


<li><b>type</b> &ndash; the data type of the
parameter's value &ndash; must be one of String, Integer, Float, or Boolean.</li>


<li><b>multiValued</b> &ndash; true if the parameter can take multiple-values (an
array), false if the parameter takes only a single value. </li>


<li><b>mandatory</b> &ndash; true if a value must be provided for the parameter
</li></ul>

<p>Both of our parameters are mandatory and accept an array
of Strings as their value.</p>

<h3><a id="_crossRef42">Configuration Parameter Settings</a></h3>

<p class="xmp">&lt;configurationParameterSettings&gt;
  &lt;nameValuePair&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Patterns&lt;/name&gt; 
    &lt;value&gt;
      &lt;array&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;b[0-4]d-[0-2]ddb&lt;/string&gt; 
        &lt;string&gt;b[G1-4][NS]-[A-Z]ddb&lt;/string&gt; 
        &lt;string&gt;bJ[12]-[A-Z]ddb&lt;/string&gt; 
      &lt;/array&gt;
    &lt;/value&gt;
  &lt;/nameValuePair&gt;
  &lt;nameValuePair&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Locations&lt;/name&gt; 
    &lt;value&gt;
      &lt;array&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;Watson - Yorktown&lt;/string&gt; 
        &lt;string&gt;Watson - Hawthorne I&lt;/string&gt; 
        &lt;string&gt;Watson - Hawthorne II&lt;/string&gt; 
      &lt;/array&gt;
    &lt;/value&gt;
  &lt;/nameValuePair&gt;
&lt;/configurationParameterSettings&gt; </p>

<h3><a id="_crossRef43">Aggregate Analysis Engine
Descriptor</a></h3>

<p class="xmp">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt; 
&lt;analysisEngineDescription xmlns=&quot;http://uima.watson.ibm.com/resourceSpecifier&quot;&gt;
  &lt;frameworkImplementation&gt;com.ibm.uima.java&lt;/frameworkImplementation&gt; 
  &lt;primitive&gt;false&lt;/primitive&gt; 

  &lt;delegateAnalysisEngineSpecifiers&gt;
    &lt;delegateAnalysisEngine key=&quot;RoomNumber&quot;&gt;
      &lt;import location=&quot;../ex2/RoomNumberAnnotator.xml&quot; /&gt; 
    &lt;/delegateAnalysisEngine&gt;
    &lt;delegateAnalysisEngine key=&quot;DateTime&quot;&gt;
      &lt;import location=&quot;TutorialDateTime.xml&quot; /&gt; 
    &lt;/delegateAnalysisEngine&gt;
  &lt;/delegateAnalysisEngineSpecifiers&gt;</p>

<p>The first difference between this descriptor and an
individual annotator's descriptor is that the <code>&lt;primitive&gt;</code>
element contains the value <code>false</code>.  This indicates that this Analysis Engine (AE)
is an aggregate AE rather than a primitive AE.</p>

<p>Then, instead of a single annotator class name, we have a
list of <code>delegateAnalysisEngineSpecifiers</code>.  Each specifies one of the components that constitute
our Aggregate .  We refer to each
component by the relative path from this XML descriptor to the component AE's
XML descriptor. </p>

<p>This list of component AEs does not imply a fixed
ordering.  Ordering is done by another
section of the descriptor:</p>

<p class="xmp"> &lt;analysisEngineMetaData&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;Aggregate TAE - Room Number and DateTime Annotators&lt;/name&gt; 
  &lt;description&gt;Detects Room Numbers, Dates, and Times&lt;/description&gt; 
  &lt;flowConstraints&gt;
    &lt;fixedFlow&gt;
      &lt;node&gt;RoomNumber&lt;/node&gt; 
      &lt;node&gt;DateTime&lt;/node&gt; 
    &lt;/fixedFlow&gt;
  &lt;/flowConstraints&gt;</p>

<p>Currently, a fixedFlow is required, and we must specify
the exact ordering in which the AEs will be executed.  In this case, it doesn't really matter, since
the RoomNumber and DateTime annotators do not have any dependencies on one
another.  </p>

<p>Finally, the descriptor has a capabilities section, which
has exactly the same syntax as a primitive AE's capabilities section:     </p>

<p class="xmp">&lt;capabilities&gt;
  &lt;capability&gt;
    &lt;inputs /&gt; 
    &lt;outputs&gt;
      &lt;type allAnnotatorFeatures=&quot;true&quot;&gt;com.ibm.uima.tutorial.RoomNumber
      &lt;/type&gt; 
      &lt;type allAnnotatorFeatures=&quot;true&quot;&gt;com.ibm.uima.tutorial.DateAnnot
      &lt;/type&gt; 
      &lt;type allAnnotatorFeatures=&quot;true&quot;&gt;com.ibm.uima.tutorial.TimeAnnot
      &lt;/type&gt; 
    &lt;/outputs&gt;
    &lt;languagesSupported&gt;
      &lt;language&gt;en&lt;/language&gt; 
    &lt;/languagesSupported&gt;
  &lt;/capability&gt;
&lt;/capabilities&gt;</p>
