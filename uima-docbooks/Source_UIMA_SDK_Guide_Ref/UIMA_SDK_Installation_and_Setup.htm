<section name="UIMA SDK Setup for Eclipse"><a id="_crossRef372"> </a>



<p>This chapter describes how to set up the UIMA SDK to work
with Eclipse.  Eclipse (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">http://www.eclipse.org</a>)
is a popular open-source Integrated Development Environment for many things,
including Java. The UIMA SDK does not require that you use Eclipse.  However, we recommend that you do use Eclipse
because some useful UIMA SDK tools run as plug-ins to the Eclipse platform and
because the UIMA SDK examples are provided in a form that's easy to import into
your Eclipse environment.</p>

<p>If you are not planning on using the UIMA SDK with
Eclipse, you may skip this chapter and read <a class="crossrefText" href="Annotator_and_Analysis_Engine_Developers_Guide.htm#_crossRef1">Chapter 4, <b>Annotator and Analysis Engine Developer&rsquo;s Guide</b></a> next.</p>

<p>This chapter provides instructions for </p>

<ul class="compact"><li>installing Eclipse, </li>


<li>installing the UIMA SDK's Eclipse
plugins into your Eclipse environment, and </li>


<li>importing the example UIMA code
into an Eclipse project.
</li></ul>

<p>The UIMA Eclipse plugins are designed to be used with
Eclipse version 3.    </p>



<subsection name="Installation"><a id="_crossRef373"> </a>



<h3><a id="_crossRef374">Install Eclipse</a></h3>

<ul class="compact"><li>Go to <a
href="http://download.eclipse.org/downloads">http://download.eclipse.org/downloads</a>  </li>


<li>We recommend using the latest
release level (not an &quot;Integration level').  Navigate to the Eclipse Release version you
want and download the archive for your platform.</li>


<li>Unzip the archive to install
Eclipse somewhere, e.g., c:\</li>


<li>Eclipse has a bit of a learning
curve.  If you plan to make significant
use of Eclipse, check out the tutorial under the help menu.  It is well worth the effort.
</li></ul>



<h3><a id="_crossRef375">Install EMF</a></h3>

<p>EMF stands for Eclipse Modeling
Framework.  It is an add-on to Eclipse,
and is used by the UIMA Eclipse tooling.  Use the built-in facilities in Eclipse to find and install new features.
</p>

<p>Activate the software feature finding by
using the menu: help &gt;&gt; Software Updates &gt;&gt; Find and Install.  Select &quot;Search for new features to
install&quot;, push &quot;Next&quot;. Specify the update site where EMF is
found as a site to search, making sure the &quot;Ignore features not applicable
to this environment&quot; box is checked, and push &quot;Finish&quot;.  You can find out where this site is by going
to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">http://www.eclipse.org</a> and
browsing for EMF.  In early 2006, the EMF
update site was <a
href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/emf/updates">http://download.eclipse.org/tools/emf/updates</a>.  If your computer is on an internet connection
which uses a proxy server, you can configure Eclipse to know about that.  Put your proxy settings into Ecluse using the
Eclipse preferences by accessing the menus: Window =&gt; Preferences... =&gt;
Install/Update, and Enable HTTP proxy connection under the Proxy Settings with
the information about your proxy. </p>

<p>This will launch a search for updates to
Eclipse; it may show a list of update site mirrors &ndash; click OK.  When it finishes, it shows a list of possible
updates in an expandable tree.  Expand
the tree nodes to find EMF SDK.  The
specific level may vary from the level shown below as newer versions are
released.</p>

<p><img alt="" width="501" height="586"
src="../UIMA_SDK_Guide_Ref/UIMA_SDK_Installation_and_Setup_files/image002.jpg"/></p>

<p>Click &quot;Next&quot;.  Then pick Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF),
and push &quot;Next&quot;, accept any licensing agreements, etc., until it
finishes the installation.  It may say
it's an &quot;unsigned feature&quot;; proceed by clicking
&quot;Install&quot;.  If it recommends
restarting, you may do that.</p>

<p>This will install EMF, without any
extras.  (If you want the whole EMF
system, including source and documentation, you can pick the &quot;EMF
SDK&quot; and the &quot;Examples for Eclipse Modeling Framework&quot;.)   </p>

<h3><a id="_crossRef376">Install the UIMA SDK</a></h3>

<p>If you haven't already done so, please
download and install the UIMA SDK from <a
href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/uima">http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/uima</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="_crossRef377">Install the UIMA Eclipse Plugins</a></h3>

<p>In the directory %UIMA_HOME%/eclipsePlugin,
you will find a zip file.  (The environment
variable %UIMA_HOME% is where you installed the UIMA SDK.)  Unzip it into your
%ECLIPSE_HOME%/eclipse/plugins directory.  %ECLIPSE_HOME% is where you installed Eclipse.</p>



<h3><a id="_crossRef378">Start Eclipse</a></h3>

<p>If you have Eclipse running, restart it (shut it down, and
start it again) using the <code>clean</code> option.  Start Eclipse by running the command <code>eclipse -clean</code> (see explanation in the next section) in
the directory where you installed Eclipse.  You may want to set up a desktop shortcut at this point for
Eclipse.  Eclipse has a bit of a learning
curve.  If you plan to make significant
use of Eclipse, check out the tutorial under the help menu.  It is well worth the effort.  There are also books you can get that
describe Eclipse and its use.</p>

<p>The first time Eclipse starts up it will take a bit longer
as it completes its installation.  A
&quot;welcome&quot; page will come up.  After you are through reading the welcome information, click on the
arrow in the upper right of the main panel to exit the welcome page and get to
the main Eclipse screens.</p>

<h4>Special startup
parameter for Eclipse: -clean</h4>

<p>If you have modified the plugin structure (by copying or
unzipping files directly in the file system) in Eclipse 3.x after you started
it for the first time, please include the &quot;-clean&quot; parameter in the startup
arguments to Eclipse, <b><i>one time</i></b>
(after any plugin modifications were done).  This is needed because Eclipse may not notice the changes you made,
otherwise.  This parameter forces Eclipse
to reexamine all of its plugins at startup and recompute any cached information
about them.</p>




  </subsection>
<subsection name="Setting up Eclipse to view Example Code"><a id="_crossRef379"> </a>



<p>Later chapters refer to example code. You can create a
special project in Eclipse to hold the examples.  Here's how:</p>

<ul class="compact"><li>In Eclipse, if the Java
perspective is not already open, switch to it by going to Window &ndash;&gt;
Open Perspective &ndash;&gt;
Java.</li>


<li>Set up a class path variable named
UIMA_HOME, whose value is the directory where you installed the UIMA SDK.,  This is done as follows:


<ul><li>Go to Window &ndash;&gt;
Preferences &ndash;&gt;
Java &ndash;&gt;
Build Path &ndash;&gt;
Classpath Variables.  </li>


<li>Click &quot;New&quot;</li>


<li>Enter UIMA_HOME (all capitals,
exactly as written) in the &quot;Name&quot; field.</li>


<li>Enter your installation directory
(e.g. <code>C:/Program Files/apache/uima</code>) in the
&quot;Path&quot; field</li>


<li>Click &quot;OK&quot; in the
&quot;New Variable Entry&quot; dialog</li>


<li>Click &quot;OK&quot; in the
&quot;Preferences&quot; dialog</li>


<li>If it asks you if you want to do a
full build, click &quot;Yes&quot;
</li></ul></li>


<li>Select the File -&gt; Import menu
option</li>


<li>Select &quot;Existing Project into
Workspace&quot; and click the &quot;Next&quot; button.</li>


<li>Click &quot;Browse&quot; and
browse to the %UIMA_HOME%\docs\examples directory</li>


<li>Click &quot;Finish.&quot;  This will create a new project called
&quot;uima_examples&quot; in your Eclipse workspace.  There should be no compilation errors. 
</li></ul>

<p>To verify that you have set up the project correctly,
check that there are no error messages in the &quot;Tasks&quot; or
&quot;Problems&quot; view.</p>




  </subsection>
<subsection name="Running external tools from Eclipse"><a id="_crossRef380"> </a>



<p>You can run outside of Eclipse using the shell scripts in
the UIMA SDK's bin directory.  In
addition, many tools can be run from inside Eclipse; examples are the Document
Analyzer, CPE Configurator, CAS Visual Debugger, Semantic Search, and JCasGen.  The uima_examples project provides Eclipse
launch configurations that make this easy to do.</p>

<p>To run these tools from Eclipse:</p>

<ul class="compact"><li>If the Java perspective is not
already open, switch to it by going to Window &ndash;&gt; Open Perspective &ndash;&gt;
Java.</li>


<li>Go to Run &ndash;&gt;
Run... </li>


<li>In the window that appears, select
&quot;UIMA CPE GUI&quot;, &quot;UIMA CAS Visual Debugger&quot;, &quot;UIMA
JCasGen&quot;, &quot;UIMA Document Analyzer&quot;, or &quot;UIMA Semantic
Search&quot; from the list of run configurations on the left. (If you don't
see, these, please select the uima_examples project and do a Menu -&gt; File
-&gt; Refresh).</li>


<li>Press the &quot;Run&quot;
button.  The tools should start.  Close the tools by clicking the &quot;X&quot;
in the upper right corner on the GUI. 
</li></ul>
