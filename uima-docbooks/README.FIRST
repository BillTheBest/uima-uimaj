If you want to render PDF files, you must get the "Java Advanced
Imaging" Library from Sun first.

Download it from https://jai.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html#Stable_builds_1.1.3
or if your company has a repository policy, see if you can get this from the
repository.

Unzip the archive and place the jai_core.jar and ja_codec.jar in the lib subdirectory.
