<chapter id="ugr.ref.javadocs">
  <title>Javadocs</title>
  
  <para>The details of all the public APIs for UIMA are contained in the API JavaDocs. These are
    located in the docs/api directory; the top level to open in your browser is called <ulink
      url="api/index.html"/>.</para>
  
  <para>Eclipse supports the ability to attach the JavaDocs to your project. To use this
    facility, open a project which is referring to the UIMA APIs in its class path, and open the
    project properties.

  <para>Once you do this, Eclipse can show you JavaDocs for UIMA APIs as you work. To see the
    JavaDoc for a UIMA API, highlight the API class or method and press shift-F2, or use the menu
    Navigate &rarr; OpenExternalJavaDoc. This will open the JavaDoc for the selected item in
    a browser.</para>
