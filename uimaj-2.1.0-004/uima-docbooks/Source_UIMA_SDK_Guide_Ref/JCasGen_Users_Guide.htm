<p>JCasGen reads a descriptor for an application, creates the
merged type system specification by merging all the type system information
from all the components referred to in the descriptor, and then uses this
merged type system to create Java source files for classes that enable JCas
access to the CAS.  Java classes are not
produced for the built-in types, except for the <code>uima.tcas.DocumentAnnotation</code>
built-in type, which is the only built-in type that can be extended by users by
adding features to it.</p>

<p>There are several versions of JCasGen.  The basic version reads an XML descriptor
which contains a type system descriptor, and generates the corresponding Java
Class Models for those types.  Variants
exist for the Eclipse environment that allow merging the newly generated Java
source code with previously augmented versions; see page <a class="crossrefPage" href="JCas_Reference.htm#_crossRef230">27-369</a> for a discussion of how the Java Class Models can be
augmented by adding additional methods and fields.  </p>

<p>Input to JCasGen needs to be mostly self-contained.  In particular, any types that are defined to
depend on user-defined supertypes must have that supertype defined, if the
supertype is <code>uima.tcas.Annotation </code>or a subtype of
it.  Any features referencing ranges
which are subtypes of uima.cas.String must have those subtypes included.  If this is not followed, a warning message is
given stating that the resulting generation may be inaccurate.  </p>

<p>JCasGen is typically invoked using a shell script.  These scripts can take 0, 1, or 2 arguments.  The first argument is the location of the
file containing the input XML descriptor.  The second argument specifies where the generated Java source code
should go.  If it isn&rsquo;t given, JCasGen
generates its output into a subfolder called JCas (or sometimes JCasNew &ndash; see
below), of the first argument&rsquo;s path.  </p>

<p>If no arguments are given to JCasGen, then it launches a
GUI to interact with the user and ask for the same input.  The GUI will remember the arguments you
previously used.  Here&rsquo;s what it looks
like:</p>

<p>When running with automatic merging of the generated Java
source with previously augmented versions, the output location is where the
merge function obtains the source for the merge operation.</p>

<p>As is customary for Java, the generated class source files
are placed in the appropriate subdirectory structure according to Java
conventions that correspond to the package (name space) name.</p>

<p>The Java classes must be compiled and the resulting class
files included in the class path of your application; you make these classes
available for other annotator writers using your types, perhaps packaged as an
xxx.jar file.  If the xxx.jar file is
made to contain only the Java Class Models for the CAS types, it can be reused
by any users of these types.</p>

<h4><a id="_crossRef223">Running stand-alone without Eclipse</a></h4>

<p>There is no capability to automatically merge the
generated Java source with previous versions, unless running with Eclipse.  If run without Eclipse, no automatic merging
of the generated Java source is done with any previous versions.  In this case, the output is put in a folder
called &quot;JCasNew&quot; unless overridden by specifying a second argument.</p>

<p>The distribution includes a shell script/bat file to run
the stand-alone version, called jcasgen.</p>

<h4><a id="_crossRef224">Running stand-alone with Eclipse</a></h4>

<p>If you have Eclipse and EMF (EMF = Eclipse Modeling
Framework; both of these are available from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">http://www.eclipse.org</a>)
installed (version 2.1 or later) JCasGen can merge the Java code it generates
with previous versions, picking up changes you might have inserted by
hand.  The output (and source of the
merge input) is in a folder &quot;JCas&quot; under the same path as the input
XML file, unless overridden by specifying a second argument.</p>

<p>You must install the UIMA plug-ins into Eclipse to enable
this function.</p>

<p>The distribution includes a shell script/bat file to run
the stand-alone with Eclipse version, called jcasgen_merge.  This works
by starting Eclipse in &quot;headless&quot; mode (no GUI) and invoking JCasGen
within Eclipse.  You will need to set the
ECLIPSE_HOME environment variable or modify the jcasgen_merge shell script to specify where to find
Eclipse.  The version of Eclipse needed
is 2.1 or higher, with the EMF plug-in and the UIMA runtime plug-in
installed.  A temporary workspace is used;
the name/location of this is customizable in the shell script.</p>

<p>Log and error messages are written to the UIMA log.  This file is called uima.log, and is located
in the default working directory, which if not overridden, is the startup
directory of Eclipse.</p>

<h4><a id="_crossRef225">Running within Eclipse</a></h4>

<p>There are two ways to run JCasGen within Eclipse, with
this release.  The first way is to
configure an Eclipse external tools launcher, and use it to run the stand-alone
shell scripts, with the arguments filled in. Here&rsquo;s a picture of a typical
launcher configuration screen (you get here by navigating from the top menu:
Run &ndash;&gt;
External Tools &ndash;&gt;
External tools...).  </p>

<p>The second way to run within Eclipse is to use the
Analysis Engine Configurator tool <i>Chapter 7. The UIMA Component Descriptor
Editor User&rsquo;s Guide</i>. This tool can be configured to automatically launch
JCasGen whenever the descriptor is modified.  In this release, this operation completely regenerates the files, even
if just a small thing changed. So you probably don&rsquo;t want to enable this all
the time.  The configurator tool has an
option to enable/disable this function.</p>
