# Configuration File for RegExAnnotator.  
# 
# File format is as follows:
# - Lines starting with # or whitepsace are ignored
# - Lines starting with % indicate an annotation type.
# - All other lines are regular expressions.  The language is that supported by Java 1.4.
#
# If a regular expression is matched, it will be annotated with the last annotation type 
# declared (the nearest preceding line starting with %).
