<p>PEAR (Processing Engine ARchive) is a new standard for
packaging UIMA compliant components. This standard defines several service
elements that should be included in the archive package to enable automated
installation of the encapsulated UIMA component. The major PEAR service element
is an XML Installation Descriptor that specifies installation platform,
component attributes, custom installation procedures and environment variables.
</p>

<p>The installation of a UIMA compliant component includes 2
steps: (1) installation of the component code and resources in a local file
system, and (2) verification of the serviceability of the installed component.
Installation of the component code and resources involves extracting component
files from the archive (PEAR) package in a designated directory and localizing
file references in component descriptors and other configuration files.
Verification of the component serviceability is accomplished with the help of
standard UIMA mechanisms for instantiating analysis engines.</p>

<p>PEAR Installer is a simple GUI based Java application that
helps installing UIMA compliant components (analysis engines) from PEAR
packages in a local file system. To install a desired UIMA component the user
needs to select the appropriate PEAR file in a local file system and specify
the installation directory (optional). During the component installation the
user can read messages printed by the installation program in the message area
of the application window. If the installation fails, appropriate error message
is printed to help identifying and fixing the problem.</p>

<p>After the desired UIMA component is successfully
installed, the PEAR Installer allows testing this component in the CAS Visual
Debugger (CVD) application, which is provided with the UIMA package. The CVD
application will load your UIMA component using its XML descriptor file. If the
component is loaded successfully, you'll be able to run it either with sample
documents provided in the <code>&lt;UIMA_HOME&gt;/docs/examples/data</code>
directory, or with any other sample documents. See <code>CASVisualDebugger.pdf</code>
in the <code>docs</code> directory for more information about the
CVD application. Running your component in the CVD application helps to make
sure the component will run in other UIMA applications. If the CVD application
fails to load or run your component, or throws an exception, you can find more
information about the problem in the uima.log file in the current working
directory.  The log file can be viewed
with the CVD. </p>

<p>PEAR Installer creates the <code>setenv.txt</code>
file in the <code>&lt;component_root&gt;/metadata</code>
directory. This file contains environment variables required to run your
component in any UIMA application. For instance, if you want to run your
component in the Collection Processing Engine Configurator GUI application, you
need to add the environment variables settings from the component's <code>setenv.txt</code> file to the <code>cpeGui.bat
(cpeGui.sh)</code> script file in the <code>&lt;UIMA_HOME&gt;/bin</code>
directory.</p>
